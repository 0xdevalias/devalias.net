SHIT TODO

- Mark posts from v1/v2 blogs seperately (tagged)?
  - "This post is from a legacy iteration of this blog (v1). As such, format may be broken, blah blah etc. Issues/pull requests are welcome @github"
- Add pingback type thing
- Checkout if disqus is configured properly, and set it up for posts
- Setup a build process into gh-pages
- Change devalias.net to point to github
- Check for any missing files from old website (ssh in and look)
- Ensure keybase http thing still validates
