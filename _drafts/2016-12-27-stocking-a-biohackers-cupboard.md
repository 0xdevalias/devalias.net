So I thought it might be cool to share some of the things I buy to keep my Biohacker's cupboard full of tasty, performance enhancing goodies; to give a little more insight into the things I use, and to make it easier for me to grab them again next time!

Lets dig in! Here's what I got in my last [Bulletproof](https://www.bulletproof.com/rewardsref/index/refer/id/7823/) order to keep me stocked over the christmas/new year period.

(Full disclosure, these links may be associated with an affiliate account, so if you buy through them i'll hopefully get a few $$ back to put towards my next order. That said, I absolutely refuse to market/promote anything I don't use/believe in myself.)

TODO: Lookup my last order, put in links to all the products, with affiliate links, maybe post a little about why for each thing.

Also, link to staples for the water, etc
