TODO: Put these bits into the old post, or link to a new post with this info from the old one. (When the site is live/I can talk about it)

(**tl;dr**: [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) is awesome, [Omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) is super useful, check out my new website [isitbulletproof.info](http://www.isitbulletproof.info))

###Is it Bulletproof?

If you know me, you know I've been following the [Bulletproof diet/lifestyle](http://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-complete-illustrated-one-page-bulletproof-diet/) (developed by [Dave Asprey](http://about.me/asprey) over at [Bulletproof Exec](http://www.bulletproofexec.com/) for quite a while now, and if you know anything about the Bulletproof diet/lifestyle, you'll know it's absolutely amazing for health, energy, focus and all those other good things that us hackery types like.

One thing I noticed in this journey of bulletproofedness (it's a technical term.. honest..) is that, while there is a TON of information (and research) on the Bulletproof blog/forums/general internet, there is a TON of information. I'm young, i'm distractible, I have better things to do with my time (or so I tell myself).

While I very much recommend actually reading all the information you can get your hands on (Knowledge is Power! and, y'know, it is YOUR health..), sometimes you just want the [tl;dr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read)

With that in mind I came up with the concept for *Is it Bulletproof?*. My goal was to keep things really simple, to the same tune of websites like [Is it Christmas?](http://isitchristmas.com/) and [What the f*ck should I make for dinner](http://www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/).

The site provides a simple answer to the simple question 'Is X bulletproof?' and then provides a stepping stone to finding more detailed information.

I could probably write more if I tried, buuuut you should just go and [check it out](http://www.isitbulletproof.info/) instead!
