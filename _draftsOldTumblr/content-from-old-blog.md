## [New Server](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=62 "Permanent Link to New Server")

<small>February 20th, 2011</small>

Currently in the process of moving all of my hosted sites across to an upgraded server. So far running smoothly, fingers crossed it remains that way.

Also, in the late stages of developing and testing a new website for&nbsp;[Black Pine Lodge](http://www.blackpinelodge.com/). Will post an update here when it is live.

## [Refresh](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=60 "Permanent Link to Refresh")

<small>December 24th, 2010</small>

It’s been a fair while since i’ve posted here (again). I think most of the reason is that I hadn’t bothered to update the WordPress backend/plugins/etc. That combined with work/life pressures meaning I haven’t really done much personal development work.

I hope in 2011 to update more, and work on a whole bunch of new projects. Until then.

## [SVN Woes](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=56 "Permanent Link to SVN Woes")

<small>May 10th, 2010</small>

I finally got around to setting up SVN on my server the other day. It took a while to remember how to do the cofiguration, and get everything going, but after a couple of (rather unfocussed) hours I got there, or so I thought.

It turns out that it didn’t want to let me view the list of repositories, instead treating me to a nice friendly 403 forbidden message. This one stumped me for a long time, with various solutions being offered up through my google searches, none of which actually fixed my problem. Eventually I came across the solution, a simple little / that should have been added to the end of the location. So in hopes that it will help someone else’s future woes (or my own if I forget) i’m putting this here.

Note: I will add the config files as reference when I get home as it’s too hard to add via my phone.

## [Moshtix Queue Bypasser](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=54 "Permanent Link to Moshtix Queue Bypasser")

<small>May 6th, 2010</small>

Heard about an interesting vulnerability today that allows you to bypass the queue to buy tickets on Moshtix. Decided it would be fun to investigate how to exploit it and write a little bookmarklet to automate the process.

It is rather simple and quickly thrown together, but it gets the job done. I may expand on it a bit in future I I can be bothered.

[Will upload at some point later, might make it member only]

## [Loving the new WordPress](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=51 "Permanent Link to Loving the new WordPress")

<small>April 5th, 2010</small>

Just a quick one. I have to say I am really loving the new WordPress. It is so much easier to keep everything up to date than the old version I was using. Not to mention how much nicer the admin interface is.

Getting the new house more sorted out, so hopefully will be able to focus on some new projects soon. Have a few ideas floating around of little thongs I wanna code up.

## [Ensquared Rebirth v2](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=14 "Permanent Link to Ensquared Rebirth v2")

<small>March 25th, 2010</small>

Ok, so once again I have neglected this site for well over a year. This was partly because I was too busy/tired from work to do anything, and partle because I changed servers and didn’t migrate wordpress properly. As of today I have reinstalled wordpress, and set it up to work properly on the new server. I have also finished my graduate program at work, so I am hoping that I will start working on some personal projects again.

All going to plan you will hear from me again soon.

## [Updates](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=8 "Permanent Link to Updates")

<small>December 30th, 2008</small>

Long time no update. A lot has been happening, but to summarise: I quit my old job, I’ve finished uni, I have a fulltime job lined up for 2009, currently looking for somewhere to live, and I have a new project in the planning stages.

I’m not going to post any details about the new project yet, but suffice to say you will hear about it when I deem it time.

Once I find somewhere to live, and get the details sorted out, I will probably post something about our network setup. It should be fun.

Until then.

## [TL – Highlight Last Viewed (Greasemonkey)](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=6 "Permanent Link to TL  Highlight Last Viewed (Greasemonkey)")

<small>May 18th, 2008</small>

Just a little note to let you guys know about a little Greasemonkey script I wrote the other day. It highlights the last viewed item in Torrentleech. Useful for seeing what content is new.

Check it out here :&nbsp;[Torrentleech – Highlight Last Viewed Torrent (Greasemonkey)](http://www.ensquared.net/wordpress/torrentleech-highlight-last-viewed-torrent-greasemonkey "Torrentleech - Highlight Last Viewed Torrent (Greasemonkey)")

## [Hello world!](http://blog.ensquared.net/?p=1 "Permanent Link to Hello world!")

<small>February 9th, 2008</small>

Welcome to the new inception of Ensquared. The old website was just sitting there unused, so I figured I would replace it with something of more use. (The old site is currently still accessible at[http://nevyn.net/~alias1/](http://nevyn.net/~alias1/ "http://nevyn.net/~alias1/")) Not sure what will be here in the longterm, but for now, this is it. Ill be using this blog to put up information on projects im currently working on (websites, programs, etc) and other similarly related things.

A little info: Ive recently started working for&nbsp;[AussieHQ](http://www.aussiehq.com.au/ "AussieHQ")&nbsp;on helpdesk, so I figured I would move ensquared.net over to their servers. In doing so, I now have access to a more functional control panel (Plesk instead of cPanel) which allows me better control over subdomains and DNS records. In light of this, I will be putting the ensquared.net domain to better use. My webbased projects (and maybe others) will more than likely have their own subdomain. I will post here when I publicly put up anything new.

I am currently working on a project called vfik (video file information kollection) I will put more details up as the project matures into a state that it can be published.

I think thats about all I have to talk about for now. Until next time.
