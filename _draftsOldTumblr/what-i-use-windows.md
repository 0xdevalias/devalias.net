# What I Use - Windows

Since I did a post about [what I use in osx](http://blog.devalias.net/post/53343491197/what-i-use-osx) I decided I should probably do one for windows too. Keep in mind since this is my main/gaming/etc computer, there's probably going to be a lot more random programs and stuff, but I'll try and filter it out to only the good stuff. Also, a lot of the programs are probably going to crossover with mac, because, y'know, they're good and exist on both platforms.

So without further ado, my windows programs! (after the break)
