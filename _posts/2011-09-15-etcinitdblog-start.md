So I have tried to do this blogging thing a few times now, both of which were on Wordpress hosted on my own server. Both of which I found I kind of never updated and then promptly forgot about for months on end. So here is attempt #3. Kind of hoping this one will actually work out. So on to what this isâ€¦ 
My aim for this blog is to write random techy type things, be they things that I have done/written, or just things that I find interesting/may want to remember later. Stick around if it sounds interesting, and we will see what we come up with.
