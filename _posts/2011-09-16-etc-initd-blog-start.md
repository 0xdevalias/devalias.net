So I have tried to do this blogging thing a few times now, both of which were on Wordpress hosted on my own server. Both of which I found I kind of never updated and then promptly forgot about for months on end. So here is attempt #3. Kind of hoping this one will actually work out. So on to what this is...

My aim for this blog is to write random techy type things, be they things that I have done/written, or just things that I find interesting/may want to remember later. Stick around if it sounds interesting, and we will see what we come up with.
