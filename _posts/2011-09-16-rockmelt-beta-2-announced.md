So in followup to my previous post on RockMelt, they have just put up news that beta 2 will be out soon with all sorts of sexy improvements! Chat had been redesigned to make chatting to multiple people easier, they have included a View Later app (think Instapaper or ReadItLater), a new Twitter app, and it now all runs on Chromium 10! I can't wait till it's available for download.

> We're excited to introduce RockMelt Beta 2! While we've shipped 20 updates since November, RockMelt Beta 2 represents our most significant revision so far.Â One thing we're really proud of is how much people actually use RockMelt. People use RockMelt for more than 6 hours each day to share links...
