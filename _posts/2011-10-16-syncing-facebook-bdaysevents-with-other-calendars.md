I’m sure i’m not alone when I say that without Facebook events/bdays I would be so much more out of the loop. A while ago I realised that I could subscribe to events/bday feeds in my external calendars (in this case, my iPhone). Best; Day; Ever! Suddenly I don’t need to be at my computer to know what’s going on, which for me is great since I tend to have the ‘out of sight out of mind’ mentality. Even if I looked at them this morning, ask me at midday and I won’t remember a thing I have planned.
In any case, this stopped working for a while, and I finally got around to reenabling it yesterday, so figured I would make a quick post about how to find it for anyone else interested.
Hope you guys enjoy/find it useful! :)
