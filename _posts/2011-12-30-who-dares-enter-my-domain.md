![who dares enter my domain]({% postfile cat.jpg %})

Just a short one today to point out that I finally got around to configuring the domain (read: defeated the dns dragon) to work properly with tumblr!

From today forwards the blog will be accessible from http://blog.devalias.net as well as the old tumblr address (which will forward to the new domain anyway)

Hope you guys enjoy!
