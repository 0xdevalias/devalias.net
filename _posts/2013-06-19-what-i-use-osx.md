I’ve been meaning to write this post for a while now, but never quite got around to it. Oftentimes when a friend or colleague gets a new mac they ask me what programs I would recommend. I tend to stumble at being asked on the spot, and rattle off the couple that jump straight to mind.

To save myself the embarassment, serve as a memory jog, and hopefully help some people out along the way, here is my list of programs I use/love on OSX (see after the break)

**Note:** This isn’t necessarily a definitive list, but it should be the main ones, and I will try to keep it updated as I find new cool things that I love.

## General/System

* [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) - Think apt-get, but for mac. Awesome way to find/install commandline tools/etc for your mac.
* [HyperDock](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/) - Show previews of docked program windows when you hover over them. Just like Windows 7!
* [TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) - Tabs and other such win for the finder!
* [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/) - A systemwide terminal that hides offscreen when you’re not using it. Combine the hotkey with BetterTouchTool for epic win!
* [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/) - Let’s you setup more touch gestures to control various things on your mac.
* [DeepSleep](http://www.axoniclabs.com/DeepSleep/) - Forces the system to do a full hibernate poweroff. No more losing battery while in your bag!
* [NoSleep](https://github.com/integralpro/nosleep) - Prevents the system from sleeping when you close the screen.
* [AppZapper](http://www.appzapper.com/) - The uninstall feature that’s missing from so many mac programs.

## Internet/Download/Etc

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - What can I say, I am very much a fan of Google, and Chrome has won my heart <3
* [uTorrent](http://ll.www.utorrent.com/intl/en/) - For those times when a distributed download is a better source than direct.

## Chat/Communication/Etc

* [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) - I don’t even need to explain this one..
* [Callnote for Skype](http://www.kandasoft.com/home/kanda-apps/callnote-skype-call-recorder) - Skype recording + Evernote. Because why remember details when you can just listen to them again!

## Music/Media/Etc

* [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/au/itunes/) - Apple, music, duh!
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) - I don’t use this a lot yet, but it’s pretty good when you don’t want to specifically decide what you want to listen to.
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) - The only media player you’ll ever need for video (or when you don’t want to clutter iTunes with random stuff yet)

## Games

* [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/about/) - The only game platform you should ever need.

## Notes/Syncing/Cloud/Etc

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) - Keeps my files synced/accessible from wherever I need them.
* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) - Think dropbox, but more aimed at notes/etc. Available anywhere I need access to them.
* [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) - Not that this fits into the cloud/syncing category by itself (dropbox!), but a good little tool for making mindmaps.

## Coding/Development/Etc

* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Kind of goes without saying. Apple’s de-facto fully integrated coding environment.
* [Sublime Text 2](https://www.sublimetext.com/2) ([Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) is currently in beta) - Tried a few others, but eventually settled on this. A REALLY nice text/code editor with tons of awesome plugins. I use the Solarized dark colour scheme.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - A free an open source distributed version control system that is made of amazing and win.
* [Le-git](http://www.git-legit.org/) - A complementary command-line interface for Git that makes some of the more obscure things much easier.
* [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/)/* [Gitbox](http://gitboxapp.com/)/* [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)/* [Github for Mac](https://desktop.github.com/) - Haven’t really decided which one is best yet, but a selection of git frontends for the (rare) times when you want a change from the command line.
* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - Only recently started playing with this, but a very nice little web app development framework/environment.
* [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) - Set of command line tools for working with/deploying to Heroku.

## Virtualisation/Etc

* [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) - IMO The better virtualisation platform for mac.
* [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) - For things that just don’t want to work in Parallels, or just for funsies.
