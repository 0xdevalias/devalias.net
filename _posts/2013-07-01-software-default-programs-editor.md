Due to some.. ahem interesting implementation choices at work, I found myself unable to make Sublime Text 2 the default program used to handle .txt files.

A quick google lead me to Default Programs Editor which provided a simple, elegant solution to my issue. Bonus points awarded for the pretty Bootstrap site and useable interface to boot!

+1 internettes to you @factormystic
