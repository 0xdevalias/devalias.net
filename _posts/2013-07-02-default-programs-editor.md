Due to some.. ahem interesting implementation choices at work, I found myself unable to make [Sublime Text 2](https://www.sublimetext.com/2) the default program used to handle .txt files.

A quick google lead me to [Default Programs Editor](http://defaultprogramseditor.com/) which provided a simple, elegant solution to my issue. Bonus points awarded for the pretty [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) site and useable interface to boot!

+1 internettes to you @factormystic
