Decided I will make this a regular little mini collection of things I learned the hard way with Ruby on Rails. So here it is, lesson #1!

Generate your model first, make all manual edits, and then only AFTER you have made all your manual edits (and double checked them), run rake db:migrate. It will save you a fair few headaches.
