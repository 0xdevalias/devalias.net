(tl;dr I wrote a chrome extension, [get it in the web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-window-with-tabs-to-r/ldahcfljppchbfgdokomobmfdfplaman) or [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/alias1/chrome-NewWindowWithTabsToRight))

So I decided I would re-dip my feet into the wonderful world that is chrome extensions. I had a little look a while back, but never really got to making anything relevant.

This time around I decided to start off simple, and something that I would find useful, so without further ado building up drumroll here is the copypasta of the description I wrote for the chrome web store (there are SO many extra little hoops you have to jump through to go from working code to published in the web store.. Maybe a potential future topic?):


> This is a simple little extension (my first proper one!) that I wanted to make my life a little easier.
> It lets you create a new window with the tabs to the right (optionally including the current tab)
> My main reason for wanting this was to more effectively make use of the 'Sesh' extension by Yuji Kosugi when I forgot to open a new window before opening a ton of tabs.
> If you have any comments, criticisms, praise, hatred, marriage proposals, fluffy bunnies, or transdimensional gateway blueprints, feel free to send them through to me at feedback@devalias.net (Make sure to mention the extension name in the subject so I know what you're talking about!)


Since that's a blockquote and I can't link in it, here is a link to [Sesh](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sesh/emclpejnhkiogdlimfgipbdfpdcnhhoj) by [Yuji Kosugi](https://about.me/yujily) (highly recommended if you're a tab junkie like myself!)

So yeah, that's it! Check it out in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-window-with-tabs-to-r/ldahcfljppchbfgdokomobmfdfplaman) and let me know what you think!!

Oh, by the way, since I love you guys and open source software, it's released under the MIT Licence and you can go and [check it out over at GitHub](https://github.com/alias1/chrome-NewWindowWithTabsToRight)! <3
