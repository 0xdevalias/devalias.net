Another quick little tool for you guys today that I hacked together to save myself some time. This one automates running through a number of tests using the [ERPScan SAP Pentesting Tool](https://erpscan.com/research/free-pentesting-tools-for-sap-and-oracle/)

At time of writing, configuration is all done inside the script, with no support for command line parameters (might add them in the future)
