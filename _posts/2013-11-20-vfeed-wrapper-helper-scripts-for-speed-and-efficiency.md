Just wanted to share some quick little bash scripts I threw together to make vFeed a little quicker/more efficient for my use.

If you donâ€™t know it already, vFeed is an Open Source Cross Linked and Aggregated Local Vulnerability Database put together by the fine folks over at ToolsWatch. You can query it for a whole bunch of information and details that may aid you in your pentests, all from the convenience of a local database.

To make life easier, I throw these scripts in my vFeed directory and symlink them from bin.


cd /path/to/bin
ln -s /path/to/vFeed/bin/vfeed.sh vfeed
ln -s /path/to/vFeed/bin/vfeedcli.sh vfeedcli
ln -s /path/to/vFeed/bin/vfeed_update.sh vfeed_update


Enjoy!
