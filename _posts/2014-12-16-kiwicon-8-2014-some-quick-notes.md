This was most definitely one of the most interesting, exciting, and downright awesome 'con experiences i've ever had! In the past i've pretty much kept to myself, watched the talks and headed home, but hung out/chatted/discussed with a lot of people over the course of the week, and it was epic! So so so definitely worthwhile!!

Not sure of the best way to go about this, so will just list out the different presentations and anything of interest/note from them.

I assume slides/etc should be up later on, so if something looks interesting, keep an eye out for that.
