Over the last few days Iâ€™ve been mentoring web dev at HS.HACT.IO, inspiring a group of younger kids to get into tech as creators. One of the other mentors showed us a site he previously put together, DogeDraw. After playing around with it for a little, I decided it was a little too manual, so started hacking away in the JS console to make it more fun.

A little while (and far too long typing out pixel art as code) later, and we have nyaan hacks! You can clear a section of the screen with a solid block of colour, or better yet, stamp out some pixel art nyaan cat across the page!

See below the cut for the gist.
