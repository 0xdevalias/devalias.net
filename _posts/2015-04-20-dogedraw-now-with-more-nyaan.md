Over the last few days I've been mentoring web dev at [HS.HACT.IO](http://hact.io/), inspiring a group of younger kids to get into tech as creators. One of the other mentors showed us a site he previously put together, [DogeDraw](http://dogedraw.com/). After playing around with it for a little, I decided it was a little too manual, so started hacking away in the JS console to make it more fun.

A little while (and far too long typing out pixel art as code) later, and we have nyaan hacks! You can clear a section of the screen with a solid block of colour, or better yet, stamp out some pixel art nyaan cat across the page!
