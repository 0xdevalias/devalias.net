Even though you pay for these boxes (US$99/quarter), it becomes another one of those background things you forget about, and then suddenly in the mail arrives this package of biohacking goodies! This one rocked up perfectly in time for actual christmas, so was a nice little addition to the festivities.

While this is the 9th box overall, it's the first shipped via the new service over at [Biohacked.com](http://biohacked.com/). If you haven't checked it out yet, I definitely recommend it.
