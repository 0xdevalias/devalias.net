Listen with an open ear;
Discuss with an open mind;
Share with open palms; and
Connect with an open heart.

My thoughts are my own,
My feelings too,
Noone causes them,
Not even you.

Feel deeply.
Share openly.
Expect nothing.

We are ultimately in control of our thoughts, actions and feelings. Noone else creates them, and to think so is to just deny our own place in the process; projecting on the other person. Be open, express your wants needs and desires; but do so without expectation.

Just because we desire something doesn't mean it exists in this time, place, or form. To project that desire onto someone else, expecting them to act in a way to fulfill it, is to expect that person to own your feelings, and be responsible for them, which cannot be.
