Surrounded by suffocation.
Pressed in by it's expanse.
Small breaths gifted.
From a finite source.

Descent into darkness.
Warmth sucked from your flesh.
All colours lost.
In the darkness of blue.

A flash in the shadow.
A shimmer of life.
Colour brought back.
By the beam of your light.

Now rising together.
Exhaustion untold.
Back to the surface.
With it's sunset of gold.
