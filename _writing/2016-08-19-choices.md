Direction on our path.
Freedom to create.
Learn and feel and laugh.
Power over hate.

But when we choose less wisely.
That power it turns back.
Choices turn against us.
Descend us into black.

Power lost so freely.
Trapped inside our mind.
Darkness grows inside us.
Hate has turned us blind.

Our choices give us power,
Or lead us to despair.
The wisdom lays before you.
The question: do you care?
