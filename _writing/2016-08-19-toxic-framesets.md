Words of accusation,
A demon painted black.
Stripped of all the power,
To even question back.

Of course they're all the same.
They'll never understand.
The same mistakes again.
Let's scar them with this brand.

But is there truth unto it?
Or perceptions conjured true?
How to even understand,
Is true for me, for you?

Words can be a knife edge.
A poison to the mind.
Question from all angles.
Don't let those spirals wind.
