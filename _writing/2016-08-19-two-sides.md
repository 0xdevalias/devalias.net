Two sides to every story,
Though mostly one is ever heard.
To hear is to believe it.
But can I trust the word?

What frame has this been told from?
What passions do distort?
Can I trust this story,
As a true factual report?

To question of a victim.
Without ascribing blame?
Does truth even matter,
As they can feel their pain?

Bias from all angles.
Passions blind the mind.
Why do we spit venom?
Can't we just be kind?
