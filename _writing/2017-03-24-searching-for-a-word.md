I'm searching for a word..

It's sort of like an intense, deep, wildly colourful feeling of both passionate loving joy, and compersion and love and wonder and beauty; mixed with an almost dark, soul wrenching, gross, melancholy despair.

It feels like if bittersweet were a stick figure, drawn in black and white; this word would be the Sistine Chapel, bathed in colour and light and intensity.

I'm not sure if there is just one word, but in searching, I feel like I've give it more meaning and power than any one word ever could. And that in itself, is beautiful.
