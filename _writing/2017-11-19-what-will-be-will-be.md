What will be will be. Someone may not talk to me for a day, week, month, year, or more; it doesn’t change what was, and it doesn’t tarnish what could be. Paths diverge; maybe they come back together and we can share new experiences and discover who we’ve become, maybe they don’t. That’s life. And I’m not really phased by that.
