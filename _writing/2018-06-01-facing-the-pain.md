These aren't my words, and I don't know the source, but I like them:

> Keeping it in, that’s not brave. Feeling the pain, facing it, that takes courage. It’s ok to let it out.

Sometimes it may feel like we should, or have to, or like we don’t know how to feel the feelings or face the pain. Not knowing is ok, but it’s those times especially that we should reach out in whatever way we feel able, to get the support or help we need, and to do everything we can to care for ourselves. I agree with the quote, but I feel it could be read as a little ‘aggressive’ without this additional caveat.

Know that whether we talk often, or rarely even see each other, if you need to talk I’m a message away. I can’t promise I will fix anything, or solve your problems, but I can listen, and I can share the love and resources I have available however I can.

Even when it feels like the world is against you, like no one cares, no one understands, like you’re trapped alone in that darkness, drowning under it all; there are so many people out there that love you, and care for you. We may just need to reach out a little so that they know we need support.
