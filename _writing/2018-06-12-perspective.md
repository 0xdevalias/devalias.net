It's always interesting when you have a change of scene or perspective, and then from that place, can look back at where you are day to day and truly wonder if it speaks to you.

Understanding the core motivators, and why you choose to do what you do. Are you acting for your true self? Or because some other unconscious aspect is playing itself out through you?

Where you can see small aspects of things that work, within the greater whole, but perhaps the rest of the things encasing that don't really speak to you, and that there is a better assortment of those variables out there that would ignite your passions in the most beautiful way.

When "because I committed to it" or $$ centres on your main reasons for doing something.. you have to question why you continue to choose that aspect.
