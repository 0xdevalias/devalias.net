This quote isn't mine, but was from [a post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=395631837510614&set=a.158289491244851&type=3)

> It just occurred to me that many people are actually afraid to heal because their entire identity is centered around the trauma they've experienced. They have no idea who they are outside of trauma, and that unknown can be terrifying.

Which inspired the following words from me:

> What are you holding onto that doesnâ€™t serve you anymore? What would your life be like free of the old stories of your wounds? When you peel back all of the layers, who are you deep inside?
