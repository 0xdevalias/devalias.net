Know that every small bit you do to improve the world matters and counts.

My personal belief is that if we focus too much on how many things are out there that need fixing it will bring us down, and realistically no one person can fix all the things. Choose our battles, and know that others will choose theirs, and together we will move the world to where it needs to be.

Stressing/worrying too much over what we aren’t able to do/help with just leaves us less actual time/energy to contribute to what we can. And even though there may be a million causes and things we want to do in this world, know that we also need to create and protect space/time for our own needs and well being. We can’t pour from an empty cup, and to burn ourselves out by pushing too hard without care is going to leave us less capable of helping/positively contributing to the world. <3
