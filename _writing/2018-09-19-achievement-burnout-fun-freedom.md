It’s an interesting feeling: breaking a pattern, and then giving yourself some time to just rest and exist. I feel like I always get myself into cycles of ‘achievement’/burnt out, and lately has definitely been the latter.

I wonder how much of the meh in my world is just constant drawn out tiredness from always trying to do too much.. and I wonder what engineering more down time, fun and freedom into my patterns would feel like.
