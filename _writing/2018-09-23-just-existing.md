Those days when you find yourself just sort of existing, not knowing what you want to do, or what you enjoy; and knowing that there are some things you probably should do, but just can’t be bothered/don’t care enough. Where nothing is particularly ‘bad’ or ‘wrong’, but also nothing really seems to be worthwhile either. Just sort of going through the motions, mindlessly following patterns, aimlessly wandering around as time flows around you.
