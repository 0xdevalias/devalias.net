In this moment, with the information I have, knowing what I know, feeling what I feel; am I ok with this/want this/etc? If so, good; within my power I choose to continue/allow it. What comes from there is up to the rest of the people/universe, as I only have power over my own actions.

If variables change in future, I will reassess then. But until that time, no reason to spend my energy/time pondering about a billion possible potentials that may never even eventuate. There are more interesting and beautiful things to find in this present moment.
