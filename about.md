[Glenn 'devalias' Grant](/author/devalias) is a full-stack, polyglot developer with an acute interest in the offensive side of security. Whether building something new or finding the cracks to break in, there is always a solution to be found; even if it requires learning something entirely new. If you can improve/automate something, do it, and if you've put the effort in to do so, open-source it and share it with everyone else.

When not hacking and coding, Glenn can be found snowboarding the peaks of Japan, finding the most efficient path between A and B (even if that's over walls), or pretending he's a fish floating around underwater. Life is short. Do the things you love, embrace the unknown, live your dreams and share your passion.
