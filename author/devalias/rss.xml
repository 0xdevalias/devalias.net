	     <p>Over the last few days I&#39;ve been mentoring web dev at <a href="http://hact.io/">HS.HACT.IO</a>, inspiring a group of younger kids to get into tech as creators. One of the other mentors showed us a site he previously put together, <a href="http://dogedraw.com/">DogeDraw</a>. After playing around with it for a little, I decided it was a little too manual, so started hacking away in the JS console to make it more fun.</p>

<p>A little while (and far too long typing out pixel art as code) later, and we have nyaan hacks! You can clear a section of the screen with a solid block of colour, or better yet, stamp out some pixel art nyaan cat across the page!</p>

<hr>

<p>This was most definitely one of the most interesting, exciting, and downright awesome &#39;con experiences i&#39;ve ever had! In the past i&#39;ve pretty much kept to myself, watched the talks and headed home, but hung out/chatted/discussed with a lot of people over the course of the week, and it was epic! So so so definitely worthwhile!!</p>

<p>Not sure of the best way to go about this, so will just list out the different presentations and anything of interest/note from them.</p>

	  <title>MDwiki (and how to get started)</title>
	  <link>/devalias/2014/07/24/mdwiki-and-how-to-get-started/</link>
	  <author>devalias</author>
	  <pubDate>2014-07-24T03:12:31+10:00</pubDate>
	  <guid>/devalias/2014/07/24/mdwiki-and-how-to-get-started/</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>(Note: Original gist can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/alias1/a8c3c2fd7bf2f50ff666">here</a>)</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already heard about it, <a href="https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md">MDwiki</a> is a cool little CMS/Wiki that runs entirely clientside (HTML5/Javascript) and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a></p>

<p>Since it&#39;s all clientside, we can do really cool things like track our changes in git and then host it all on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. That means super simple forking, contributing and sharing. Yay for open source!</p>

<h2>Setting up MDwiki with GitHub</h2>

<p>There is an <a href="https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!tutorials/github.md">official guide</a> available on the MDwiki site, but I kind of like to do things my own way, so below is how I go about setting up a new site. (I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re already setup on GitHub and know vaguely how to use it, if not, maybe checkout the guide above)</p>

<ul>
<li>On GitHub

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/new">Create a new repository</a> and name it what you want (eg. <code>my-mdwiki</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Setup initial MDwiki bits

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki/releases">Download the latest MDwiki release</a></li>
<li>Extract it to a folder (eg. <code>my-mdwiki</code>)</li>
<li>Here you have a choice:</li>
<li><code>mdwiki.html</code> will give you MDwiki and all of it&#39;s libraries packaged as a single file</li>
<li><code>mdwiki-slim.html</code> (my preference) will give you MDwiki, but load it&#39;s libraries from a CDN (content delivery network)</li>
<li>Choose the option you want to use and rename it to <code>index.html</code></li>
<li>Next we&#39;ll need to create a <code>config.json</code> file. You can <a href="https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!customizing.md">read about how this works</a> or just use something similar to mine:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="nt">"lineBreaks"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"gfm"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="nt">"additionalFooterText"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"By &lt;a href='http://www.devalias.net/'&gt;Glenn '/dev/alias' Grant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="nt">"anchorCharacter"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"&amp;para;"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Almost there, create a quick <code>navigation.md</code> (<a href="https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!quickstart.md">docs</a>) that looks something like</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang=""># Your wiki name

[Home](index.md)
[About](about.md)
[Download](download.md)
</code></pre></div>
<p>And create your first page (i&#39;ll only show you one, but the process is the same). Create a file called <code>index.md</code> (as specified in your navigation)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang=""># Hello World!

This is my first page!
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>That&#39;s it for the basic site setup!</li>
<li>As a little bonus, I like to add a script to run a <code>python SimpleHTTPServer</code> for local testing called <code>run-pyserver.sh</code> (and make sure to make it executable with <code>chmod +x run-pyserver.sh</code>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

open http://localhost:8000
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Now we&#39;ll setup our git repo:

<ul>
<li>Open a terminal window, and navigate to the folder you just created (eg. <code>cd ~/my-mdwiki</code>)</li>
<li>Initialise the git repo: <code>git init</code></li>
<li>Here we use some <a href="http://www.retrologic.com/jargon/M/magic.html">magic</a> (from <a href="http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/how-to-start-with-non-master-branch-tt3284326.html#a3284821">Sean Estabrooks</a>) to tell git to call the initial branch <code>gh-pages</code> instead of <code>master</code>: <code>git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages</code></li>
<li>Add all the files we&#39;ve created so far: <code>git add .</code></li>
<li>Commit them: <code>git commit -m &quot;Initial Commit&quot;</code></li>
<li>Add your GitHub repo as a remote (making sure to replace <code>YOURUSERNAME</code> with your actual username, and <code>my-mdwiki</code> with the name of the repository you created earlier): <code>git remote add origin git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/my-mdwiki.git</code></li>
<li>Then push it to github: <code>git push -u origin gh-pages</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>That&#39;s pretty much it! After a short delay, your site should be available at <a href="http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/my-mdwiki">http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/my-mdwiki</a></li>
</ul>

	  <title>Play! Framework - Seperated WS Library</title>
	  <link>/devalias/2014/06/26/play-framework-seperated-ws-library/</link>
	  <author>devalias</author>
	  <pubDate>2014-06-26T03:48:00+10:00</pubDate>
	  <guid>/devalias/2014/06/26/play-framework-seperated-ws-library/</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>So as we all (should) know, <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play! Framework</a> has released <a href="https://www.typesafe.com/blog/announcing-play-230">v2.3.x</a></p>

<p>With it comes a <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Highlights23">whole range</a> of new features, including one that caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Play WS</p>

<p>Separate library</p>

<p>The WS client library has been refactored into its own library which can be used outside of Play. You can now have multiple WSClient objects, rather than only using the WS singleton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was particularly exciting for me, as I&#39;ve grown to know, understand and love the simple abstractions the Play WS library provides.</p>

<p>Sweet! So how do I get it in my projects? Had a look over at <a href="https://github.com/playframework">playframework@Github</a> to no avail (was expecting a new repo)</p>

<p>After a little more digging, I came across the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Repositories">Play! Repositories</a> page, which lead me to finding what I wanted.</p>

<p>A little xml magic later and we have the following for a maven project wanting to use the Java version of the WS library:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.typesafe.play&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;play-java-ws_2.10&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.3.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;

&lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;Typesafe Releases&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Hope this saves you guys some time, and as always, happy hacking!</p>

<h2>&quot;There is no started application&quot;</h2>

<p>If you end up getting a &quot;There is no started application&quot; message when you try to use WS, you will need to do something like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">AsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder builder = new com.ning.http.client.AsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder();
NingWSClient wsClient = new play.libs.ws.ning.NingWSClient(builder.build());

// Instead of this
//WSRequestHolder ws = WS.url(url)

// Use this
WSRequestHolder ws = wsClient.url(url)
</code></pre></div>
<p>See the following for more details:</p>

<li>Scala - Using WSClient: <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ScalaWS">http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ScalaWS</a></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

	     <p>Rather than trying to make everybody everywhere adapt their systems to try and handle everything that could possibly ever exist (a monumental task), have a &#39;new&#39; thing that is flexible enough to be able to interface with everything else.</p>

<p>Thinking about it now, it&#39;s the exact same way as I look at the transition from legacy silo&#39;s to &#39;the future&#39; of personal clouds/etc. Sure, the ideal is that everything is free and open and interacts perfectly, but the reality is that that&#39;s not where we are at today, and there is a very real need for these &#39;bridging technologies&#39; to ease that transition as we move forward, and give us the wins of the future technology, without having to wait for the lag of general industry to catch up.</p>

	     <p>A side by side comparison (now that I finally got it figured out!) of <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play Framework</a> v2.2.x promise unwrapping in <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> and <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. Hopefully this will be able to save some of you a bunch of mind numbing ponderings and failures.</p>

	  <title>Using Lombok with Play! Framework 2.2x</title>

	     <p><a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok</a> is a project that removes some of the tediousness of Java by letting you use annotations to replace the verbosity of Getters/Setters (and heaps of other cool things!)</p>

<ul>
<li>This is mostly a note for me to help save a TON of time screwing around again.</li>
<li>Play 2.2.x works &#39;out of the box&#39; just by including lombok in your dependencies</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  foo,
  bar,
  baz,
  "org.projectlombok" % "lombok" % "1.12.6"
)
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Where you run into issues is that play eclipse won&#39;t add the correct stuff for lombok to work correctly.</li>
<li>After a lot of messing around, I just went back to the method suggested on the site

<ul>
<li>Download from <a href="http://projectlombok.org/download.html">http://projectlombok.org/download.html</a></li>
<li>Run the installer and let it configure Eclipse</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

	  <title>VLC 2.1.x AC3/5.1 Audio Issues (and how to fix them)</title>
	  <link>/devalias/2014/04/10/vlc-2-1x-ac3-5-1-audio-issues-and-how-to-fix/</link>

	     <p>So, just lost an hour or two debugging some audio issues that seemed to crop up in VLC. I have a 5.1 setup, which will disable the speakers when I plug in a 2-channel set of headphones (pretty straightforward). For some strange reason this stopped working sometime recently. I assumed maybe audio drivers (windows update) or something else weird like that, but turns out it was VLC (which I forgot I had upgraded)</p>

<p>Old versions of VLC (pre 2.1.x) allowed you to &#39;force&#39; a downscale in situations like this through the <code>rAudio -&gt; Audio Device -&gt; Stereo</code> right click menu option. Turns out, this feature was removed (and the menu item repurposed) in VLC 2.1.x. According to  <a href="https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=115203#p394432">Jean-Baptiste Kempf on the VLC forums</a> this feature won&#39;t be coming back anytime before 2.2.x</p>

<p>So what do we do in the meantime? If you haven&#39;t upgraded to 2.1.x yet and need this feature then don&#39;t upgrade. If you already have, downgrade to 2.0.8 (Windows) or 2.0.9 (OSX/Linux)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.8/win32/">2.0.8 Win32</a> (<a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.8/win32/vlc-2.0.8-win32.exe">EXE</a>, <a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.8/win32/vlc-2.0.8-win32.zip">ZIP</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.8/win64/">2.0.8 Win64</a> (<a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.8/win64/vlc-2.0.8-win64.exe">EXE</a>, <a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.8/win64/vlc-2.0.8-win64.zip">ZIP</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.9/macosx/">2.0.9 OSX</a> (<a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.9/macosx/vlc-2.0.9-intel64.dmg">DMG</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.9/">2.0.9 Linux</a> (<a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.0.9/vlc-2.0.9.tar.xz">XZ</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this saves you guys some time and effort!!</p>

	  <title>Hacking Unicoins for Fun and Profit (Stackoverflow.com April Fools 2014)</title>
	  <link>/devalias/2014/04/02/hacking-unicoins-for-fun-and-profit/</link>
	  <author>devalias</author>
	  <pubDate>2014-04-02T06:38:02+11:00</pubDate>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> introduced an amusing little April Fools feature called &#39;Unicoins&#39;. Essentially, this currency (that you can earn by mining rocks, since all of the (rather amusing) payment options are currently unavailable&#39;) allows you to by silly upgrades for the website. From &#39;Colorful comments&#39; and &#39;Guaranteed Answer&#39; through to &#39;Voting animations&#39; which gives you &#39;happy unicorn animations everytime you vote&#39;.</p>

<p>Anyways, long story short, I saw a system and wondered how to beat it. Turns out each rock is simply an AJAX request to /unicoin/rock to get a rock ID, and when you sucessfully mine it, you POST back a static fkey (bound to each user I assume?) and the rockId to /unicoin/mine?rock=theRockId</p>

<p>I&#39;ve put together a little automagical javascript to prevent you all getting RSI. It&#39;s for health reasons.. honestly.</p>

<p>Enjoy your unicoins! &lt;3 /dev/alias</p>
