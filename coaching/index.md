[Glenn 'devalias' Grant](/author/devalias) is a Bulletproof Coach-in-Training, currently studying through the Bulletproof Training Institute, and set to graduate in 2017.

I found Bulletproof after struggling with health and weight issues over the years. It was the catalyst I needed to start cleaning up my diet, learn to appreciate whole foods, and really discover the joy of being on a path of constantly improving myself, my health and my focus.

If you want to know more about the coach training, feel free to check out the course outline over at the [Bulletproof Training Institute](https://bi198.isrefer.com/go/CoachTraining/alias/).
