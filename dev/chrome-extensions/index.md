Since I decided to have another crack at chrome extensions, I figured I really should have somewhere to link to them.. so.. here it is!

There might not be many, and they might not interest you, but I will probably keep churning them out occasionally as I feel the need to fill a gap/fix an issue that isn't adequately solved elsewhere (As 37signals says: Scratch Your Own Itch)

* [New Window With Tabs To Right](new-window-with-tabs-to-right) â€“ A simple little extension (my first proper one!) that will open a new window with the tabs to the right! (funnily enough)
