I think about a lot of things, and I find it's far easier to dump them out into loosely categorised collections for future browsing/reference than to keep it all locked up in my head. Who knows, you might even find something useful among it all!

## Glenn 'devalias' Grant Notes

* [Neural Mind](http://0xdevalias.github.io/devalias-neuralmind) ([GitHub](https://github.com/0xdevalias/devalias-neuralmind/)) - This site is a neural dumping ground, a collection of random information, thoughts, musings, links and any other related data that needs a structured home somewhere outside of my mind.
* [Health Hacks](http://0xdevalias.github.io/devalias-healthhacks) ([GitHub](https://github.com/0xdevalias/devalias-healthhacks/)) - A collection of random information, thoughts, musings, links and any other related data with regards to hacking and optimising health and performance.
* [Biznotes](http://0xdevalias.github.io/devalias-biznotes) ([GitHub](https://github.com/0xdevalias/devalias-biznotes/)) - A simple place to keep track of business/contracting relevant notes, requirements, hacks, etc.

## Hack*

This is an experiment in gathering information useful to entrepreneurs, startups, geeks, etc for various cities that hold my interest. Starting with Canberra, but in future I may expand this to Melbourne, Sydney, Vancouver, Tokyo, and anywhere else that takes my fancy/interest.

* [Hack Canberra Wiki](http://0xdevalias.github.io/hackcanberra-wiki/#!index.md) ([GitHub](https://github.com/0xdevalias/hackcanberra-wiki/)) - This is a community effort to document and shine some light on the cool things happening in and around Canberra related to startups, hacker/coworking spaces, technology, design, business, Goverment 2.0 and all manner of other interesting stuff.
