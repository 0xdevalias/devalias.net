_(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek Sivers's](https://sivers.org/now). If you want something more general, maybe you want the [about page](/about))_

Living in **Canberra, Australia**.

Working at **[Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)** doing **Software Engineering** things, but still with a strong interest in **bug bounties**, **pentesting**, and **InfoSec** in general.

**Outside of work** my time/energy is mostly split between **[dance](/personal/interests/dance/)** (hip hop, breaking, etc. at [Project Beats](https://www.projectbeats.com.au/)), **side projects** ([GitHub](https://github.com/0xdevalias), [Blog](/)) such as [BountyMachine](/tag/bountymachine/), and random bouts of inspiration/**[writing](/writing)**.

Recently I've been excitedly discovering a whole new world in the **hardware/electronics/maker** side of things. I'll often go down random **research** rabbitholes in **health, wellness, tech,** or some combination of; and my intention is to collate and capture what I learn in blog posts as I go.

A [recent post]({% post_url 2018-04-20-imagine-a-world %}) summarises my **current attitudes** towards things:

> Empowering new builders, thinkers and makers with the tools and knowledge to step just a little further, reach a little higher.

Or said another way:

> Understanding how overpriced products work, and devising better/cheaper open hardware designed alternatives. Democratising and de-commercialising the world.
