[[Home](/) > Speaker]

At the start of 2017 I decided that I would like to "get out there more" and "speak about the things I do". Since then, I have had a number of opportunities to connect with the community; sharing my ideas, thoughts, projects, and methodologies with the world.

To date, topics have largely focussed around the fusion of Security and Development, with a sprinkling of personal development/mental health/'attitudinal' concepts throughout.

You can find my slides on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/0xdevalias) and/or [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/GlenndevaliasGrant). Related code, notes, slides, or similar [should be on my GitHub tagged 'presentation' or 'slides'](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Apresentation+topic%3Aslides+user%3A0xdevalias+user%3ABountyMachine&type=Repositories). Any videos of my talks should be [posted directly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2W-Kw24Zpg&list=PLGuyVypPuniX3CdC_9fCtVpuPLV79iVdX) or [linked to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adWzygDdQLw&list=PLGuyVypPuniWcIU7WrPKtfNeWYe0bqJKR) on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbGD_muZ_KB8R5L1fh4ZZnw).
