	     <p>So here comes the obligatory post about my resolutions for 2012. In no particular order or level of detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend more time hanging out and chatting with friends. Those who are physically close as well as those far away; in person, on the phone and online; those who I am close to and those I should be closer with.</li>
<li>Put more time into coding/web design/development tasks with the aim of getting at least 1 app out this year.</li>
<li>Open source anything and everything I do that isn't a 'trade secret' (More on this to come later). Who knows what people will be able to find a use for. Also contribute back anything I can to open source projects I use.</li>
<li>Continue to read, learn and grow; be it in technical skill, learning about myself, or the world; and share what I learn with everyone and anyone who is interested. (Essentially open source whatever knowledge I gain)</li>
<li>Be more forward and take (calculated) risks even when they seem scary. (Talking to someone new/interesting/cute, giving that project a go, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>This one isn't a resolution so much as a goal but a notable thing to do in any case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure all of my hard drives utilise full disk encryption, using a strong password. ''The man' thinks he is too good these days, so why not stick it to him in a simple, fun, and secure way. (See the article on EFF.org)</li>
</ul>
