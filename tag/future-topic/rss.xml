	     <p>Over the past 6 months or so I have learnt just how productive I can be working outside of home. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the change of scene, having less distractions, or merely that a fresh cup of coffee is only a question away. Perhaps a topic for a future post? One thing is certain though, unless your local haunt has a ready supply of power points (and is happy to let you use them) you&#39;re hack sessions are going to be rather shortlived.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that I decided to invest in an external battery for my laptop, in particular the HyperJuice External Battery for MacBook (150Wh). I should note that there are other sizes available too (60Wh, 100Wh, 222Wh), but for the price/performance tradeoff I decided on this one.</p>

<p>My aim of this post isn&#39;t to write a sales pitch or anything like that, though I must say that I was quite impressed with how sleek the casing design was. Personally I would have much preferred it in a matte black (even if this does match the MacBook Pro unibody better), but I guess beggars can&#39;t be choosers.</p>

<p>Packing 150Wh this thing isn&#39;t exactly what I would call lightweight, weighing in at approx 1.09kg and boasting &quot;up to 34 hours MacBook usage!!!!!&trade;&quot; That is of course if you happen to subscribe to their particular scenario..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MacBook Pro 13&quot; with 63.5-watt-hour (10 hours) rated internal battery, rounded to the nearest hour. Requires MagSafe Airline Adapter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On my MacbookPro 15&quot; with the screen set kind of bright, my iPhone plugged in to the USB port for internet tethering, and a plethora of tabs open in Rockmelt I find the real world usage is rather.. not quite as much. I haven&#39;t actually bothered to work it out properly, but at a rough guess I would say I get between 2-4 hours off my internal battery, and then maybe 2-5 hours off the external. It seems it varies quite a bit too, though I haven&#39;t really looked into why. I am also using the HyperJuice Magic Box to modify my existing MagSafe charger rather than a MagSafe Airline Adapter. Maybe changing to that will cause some magical additional battery life?</p>

<p>Finally, price. At US$350 odd for the 150Wh model this thing isn&#39;t exactly the cheapest piece of tech i&#39;ve ever bought. That being said, the fact that it at least doubles the length of my cafe based hack sessions means i&#39;m pretty ok with it.</p>

<p>All in all i&#39;m pretty impressed with the HyperJuice, though if I had my time again I would probably buy the 222Wh (to help make up the difference between marketing charge life and real world life) Hopefully in the near future someone will bring out something cheaper/more powerful (~$125 per 400Wh/kg), preferably in sandblasted matte black, but until then the HyperJuice is definitely worth a look.</p>

	  <title>Resolutions for 11111011100 [2012]</title>

	     <p>So here comes the obligatory post about my resolutions for 2012. In no particular order or level of detail:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spend more time hanging out and chatting with friends. Those who are physically close as well as those far away; in person, on the phone and online; those who I am close to and those I should be closer with.</li>
<li>Put more time into coding/web design/development tasks with the aim of getting at least 1 app out this year.</li>
<li>Open source anything and everything I do that isn&#39;t a &#39;trade secret&#39; (More on this to come later). Who knows what people will be able to find a use for. Also contribute back anything I can to open source projects I use.</li>
<li>Continue to read, learn and grow; be it in technical skill, learning about myself, or the world; and share what I learn with everyone and anyone who is interested. (Essentially open source whatever knowledge I gain)</li>
<li>Be more forward and take (calculated) risks even when they seem scary. (Talking to someone new/interesting/cute, giving that project a go, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>This one isn&#39;t a resolution so much as a goal but a notable thing to do in any case:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure all of my hard drives utilise full disk encryption, using a strong password. &#39;&#39;The man&#39; thinks he is too good these days, so why not stick it to him in a simple, fun, and secure way. (See the article on EFF.org)</li>
</ul>
