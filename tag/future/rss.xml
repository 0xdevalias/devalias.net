	     <p>Rather than trying to make everybody everywhere adapt their systems to try and handle everything that could possibly ever exist (a monumental task), have a &#39;new&#39; thing that is flexible enough to be able to interface with everything else.</p>

<p>Thinking about it now, it&#39;s the exact same way as I look at the transition from legacy silo&#39;s to &#39;the future&#39; of personal clouds/etc. Sure, the ideal is that everything is free and open and interacts perfectly, but the reality is that that&#39;s not where we are at today, and there is a very real need for these &#39;bridging technologies&#39; to ease that transition as we move forward, and give us the wins of the future technology, without having to wait for the lag of general industry to catch up.</p>

	     <p>A side by side comparison (now that I finally got it figured out!) of <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play Framework</a> v2.2.x promise unwrapping in <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> and <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. Hopefully this will be able to save some of you a bunch of mind numbing ponderings and failures.</p>
