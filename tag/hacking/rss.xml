<hr>

<p>This was most definitely one of the most interesting, exciting, and downright awesome &#39;con experiences i&#39;ve ever had! In the past i&#39;ve pretty much kept to myself, watched the talks and headed home, but hung out/chatted/discussed with a lot of people over the course of the week, and it was epic! So so so definitely worthwhile!!</p>

<p>Not sure of the best way to go about this, so will just list out the different presentations and anything of interest/note from them.</p>

<p>I assume slides/etc should be up later on, so if something looks interesting, keep an eye out for that.</p>
