	     <p>So in order to run the iPad through a debug proxy (Burp Suite), and still be able to forward on the traffic to the net, I needed to be able to talk to it over USB. (yay limited tech to work with!)</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t actually too hard to get going thanks to a little tool called usbmuxd.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<ol>
<li>Install usbmuxd (i did this through homebrew: brew install libmuxd)</li>
<li>Startup the included iproxy tool (<code>iproxy LOCAL_PORT DEVICE_PORT)iproxy 2222 22</code>)</li>
<li>Plug in your iDevice (I assume you already have SSH setup on it and enabled)
SSH to localhost:LOCAL_PORT, making sure to specify the account you want to logon as <code>ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222</code></li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>

<p>Yay for things just working how they should!</p>
