   <description>My intention is for this to be a place where I post anything that interests my geeky mind. I may not update it often, and you may not find it that interesting.. You've been forewarned.

	     <p>Decided I will make this a regular little mini collection of things I learned the hard way with Ruby on Rails. So here it is, lesson #1!</p>

<p>Generate your model first, make all manual edits, and then only AFTER you have made all your manual edits (and double checked them), run rake db:migrate. It will save you a fair few headaches.</p>
