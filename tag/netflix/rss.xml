	     <p>If you haven't yet come across <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>, it's kind of exciting stuff. It's a query language developed by <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/">Facebook</a>, that basically lets you request exactly the data you need for the given task; no more, no less. Sounds good right?</p>
<h2>Tell me more..</h2>
<p>If you like to get into the nitty gritty of tech specs, you can head over to the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/graphql/">GraphQL Working Draft</a> (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/graphql">GitHub</a>) to have a deeper read, then play around with the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js">reference implementation</a> in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Though if specs aren't really your style, check out '<a href="https://learngraphql.com/">Learn GraphQL</a>' and give their free short course a run through. Should get you up to speed!</p>
<h2>Ok. I'm in!</h2>
<p>Excited? Want to dive into it? Need libraries for your particular tech stack? Head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql">Awesome GraphQL</a> list. You're bound to find what you need!</p>
<p>For my particular tech palette I was after something <a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala'esque</a>, maybe some <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/http/">Akka-HTTP</a> to go with it. Seems I wasn't the only one! <a href="http://sangria-graphql.org/">Sangria</a> (<a href="https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria">GitHub</a>) is a Scala GraphQL implementation. They even have <a href="https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-akka-http-example">an Akka-HTTP based example</a>. Perfect! Throw in a little <a href="https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-relay">Relay support</a> and this package is pretty much complete.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an all-in-one stack heading forward, I keep seeing a lot of good things posted by the team at <a href="http://www.apollostack.com/">Apollo Stack</a> (by the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> team), so would most definitely recommend keeping an eye on them. They also post a lot of really good articles <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-stack">on their blog</a> too.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a name="graphql-relay-redux"></a>GraphQL and Relay.. What about Redux?</h2>
<p>A lot of things you'll read about GraphQL on the net will talk about it quite closely with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a>, and given they were both released by Facebook, and sort of designed to work together, it makes a lot of sense. That said, you most definitely don't need to use Relay to take advantage of the awesomeness GraphQL provides!</p>
<p>KADIRA states it pretty well in <a href="https://kadira.io/blog/graphql/graphql-vs-relay">GraphQL vs Relay</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GraphQL provides a way to model and expose data in your app. You can use it on top of any kind of data source and use it with any kind of transport layer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Relay is an efficient client-side data-fetching technology built for React. It talks to a GraphQL Schema to get data. Relay also has a server-side part that adds some features on top of GraphQL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a bunch of talk about how Relay is currently a pain to use, but Facebook seems to be <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/08/05/relay-state-of-the-state.html">well aware of this issue</a> and has future plans to make it much nicer to work with.</p>
<p>I think it's definitely worth keeping an eye on Relay in the future, but if you're not quite ready to jump in, you can always take advantage of the benefits of GraphQL while sticking to something like <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> (<a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">GitHub</a>).

<h2>GraphQL vs Falcor</h2>
<p>So by now we should have a fairly good idea about what <a href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is. So what's <a href="http://netflix.github.io/falcor/">Falcor</a>? This one comes from our friends over at <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>. In essence, it turns all of your data sources into one giant JSON graph. Regardless of whether you're loading data remotely, have it cached locally, etc; you'll access it in the same way.</p>
<p>If you want to read deeper, I found these to be quite useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32057785/what-is-the-difference-between-falcor-and-graphql">&quot;What is the difference between Falcor and GraphQL?&quot; on StackOverflow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/apollo-stack/graphql-vs-falcor-4f1e9cbf7504">&quot;GraphQL vs. Falcor&quot; by Jonas Helfer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://react-etc.net/entry/beyond-rest-graphql-vs-falcor">&quot;Beyond REST: GraphQL vs. Falcor&quot; by React-Etc</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The consensus that I came to is that it seems to be on par with GraphQL in a number of ways, but is probably a bit easier to implement and a bit less powerful overall. Apparently you could even go so far as to <a href="http://hueypetersen.com/posts/2015/10/26/querying-graphql-with-falcor/">query GraphQL with Falcor</a>, but not the other way. For my purposes, I think I'll be sticking with GraphQL.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Facebook has been using various flavours of GraphQL for a few years now, whereas Netflix is yet to (or has only recently) started using Falcor in production.</p>
<h2>API's: REST, HATEOS, Observables.. GraphQL!</h2>
<p>I have read SO many articles over the years about the 'proper' way to design API's, and why styleX is so much better than styleY. With so much info out there, and so much conflicting advice (even within each supposed style), it's really easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis.</p>
<p>Greg Ziegan put together a <a href="https://medium.com/@gregoryziegan/how-graphql-taught-me-to-code-client-apps-1c631a9953bd">nice little article</a> talking about his progression along this path: from REST, through <a href="http://timelessrepo.com/haters-gonna-hateoas">HATEOS</a>, observables, etc; and how he ended up at GraphQL. Following on from this, Sashko Stubailo makes a pretty good argument about why GraphQL is <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-stack/graphql-the-next-generation-of-api-design-f24b1689756a">&quot;the next generation of API design&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>While the benefits of a GraphQL-based API seem pretty obvious to me, it's not always feasible to jump straight into shiny new tech. Maybe you need to support legacy services, interact with 3rd-party API's, or allow other developers to consume your API without them having to learn the ins and outs of GraphQL. But thankfully, we don't need to pick one over the other!</p>
<p>The GraphQL team have a pretty good article on their blog about <a href="http://graphql.org/blog/rest-api-graphql-wrapper/">wrapping REST API's in GraphQL</a>, starting purely with the client-side, and later moving it to the backend. This idea plays in SO well with some little side-projects I've been thinking about over the years, and how it could be used to help decompose and combine existing API's.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is a scattering of the articles and things I have read through while learning more about GraphQL, and why it is so awesome. I definitely know it's a technology that I am super excited to start utilising in my future projects.</p>
<p>Have you come across any other awesome articles/tools related to GraphQL or similar? I'd love to hear about them! Let me know in the comments below.</p>

	     <p>Living in share houses and using tech like the Apple TV has highlighted an annoying situation: so many apps these days want you to sign in to enable access, personalised features, etc; but most offer no good solution for when you share the device with other people.</p>
<p>There are some apps out there that handle this pretty well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> allows you to switch between different users in your 'home', each of which can either be a fully independent account, or a 'managed user' that exists under the main account.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/au/">Netflix</a> allows switching between different users under the one subscription. While this is ok.. it doesn't work so well for a share house. What if we each have our own Netflix subscriptions, but want to share the device without having to log out and back in to our own accounts?</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there are so many apps that don't even seem to give the option, two of which immediately jump to mind for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> let's you sign in to a single account, but no switching features save for logging out.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ted.com/">TED</a>'s app suffers from the same issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>This could be fixed at the individual app level. It would be REALLY nice to see support for multiple account switching added to any app made for a device that could potentially be shared (Apple TV/etc, far less likely to be useful on an iPhone.. but it might be for some users) But this requires extra effort from every app developer out there. Perhaps a common framework could be developed to help support this.. but then making it generic enough to fit into everyone's different architectures would be a challenge.</p>
<p>An even better solution could be baked into the OS itself by Apple.. I boot up my Apple TV and am presented with an account chooser asking which particular registered user I am. If I haven't already logged in, there's the option for signing in to my Apple account to add myself as a new user. Once logged in, I'm presented with my own homescreen of apps, laid out to my own preferences, logged in to my own accounts, and saving my own personal data.</p>
<p>This poses some issues about duplication of apps between users, space requirements, etc. So a mid-ground could be allowing the owner/'master' user to control app installation, but then for each other user to be able to maintain their own stored data/signin status/etc.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is this a feature you'd use, or does it just seem like over-engineered bloat? Let me know your thoughts in the comments!</p>
