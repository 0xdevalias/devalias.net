	     <p>Over the last few days I&#39;ve been mentoring web dev at <a href="http://hact.io/">HS.HACT.IO</a>, inspiring a group of younger kids to get into tech as creators. One of the other mentors showed us a site he previously put together, <a href="http://dogedraw.com/">DogeDraw</a>. After playing around with it for a little, I decided it was a little too manual, so started hacking away in the JS console to make it more fun.</p>

<p>A little while (and far too long typing out pixel art as code) later, and we have nyaan hacks! You can clear a section of the screen with a solid block of colour, or better yet, stamp out some pixel art nyaan cat across the page!</p>
