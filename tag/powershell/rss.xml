	     <p>Something that I needed to do in an engagement recently and thought it might be useful to you guys. Here&#39;s a little function and demonstration to show just how insecure it is to store an encrypted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell">PowerShell</a> <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/4546.working-with-passwords-secure-strings-and-credentials-in-windows-powershell.aspx">&#39;SecureString&#39;</a> WITH the key to decrypt it in a script file (or anywhere for that matter)</p>

<p>Just goes to show that no matter how secure a technology you create, in the end it all comes down to the underpaid, overworked IT staff that have to implement it, and the <em>managerial guidelines</em> that they need to work within.</p>
