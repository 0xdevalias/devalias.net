<p>I tend to dive down rabbit holes a lot, and given the cost of context switching and memory deteriorating over time, sometimes the state I build up in my mind gets lost between the chances I get to dive in. These &#39;linkdump&#39; posts are an attempt to collate at least some of that state in a way that I can hopefully restore to my brain at a later point.</p>

<p>This time around I was inspired to look into USB reverse engineering, protocol analyis, hardware hacking, and what would be involved in implementing custom drivers for arbitrary hardware. Or put another way: <strong>how do I hack all of the USBs?!??</strong></p>

<p>It seems the deeper I went, the more interesting I found the content, and this post grew and grew. Hopefully it will help to shortcut your own journey down this path, and enlighten you to a whole new area of interesting things to hack!</p>

<h2><a name="intro-to-usb"></a>Intro to USB</h2>

<p>USB (universal serial bus) is an industry standard covering cables, connectors and protocols; and is pretty ubiquitous among tech products these days. I won&#39;t get deep on describing all of the facts, since that&#39;s what Wikipedia is good at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That said, it will be useful to understand some of the aspects of how USB devices and protocols are laid out, and some of the terminology used.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#System_design">USB system</a> (<a href="https://www.linuxvoice.com/drive-it-yourself-usb-car-6/">see also</a>) has:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>host</strong>, with one or more downstream ports, and multiple peripherals</li>
<li><strong>Hubs</strong> may be included, allowing up to 5 tiers</li>
<li>A host may have multiple controllers, each with one or more ports</li>
<li>Up to 127 devices can be connected to a single host controller</li>
<li>A <strong>device</strong> may have several logical sub-devices, referred to as <strong>&#39;device functions&#39;</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>composite device</strong> may provide multiple functions (eg. webcam + microphone)</li>
<li>A <strong>compound device</strong> connects logical devices to a built in hub</li>
</ul>

<p>Digging into the protocol/communication side of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication is based on <strong>pipes</strong> (logical channels), between the host and an endpoint (logical entity) on a device</li>
<li>A device can have <strong>up to 32 endpoints</strong> (16 IN, 16 OUT)</li>
<li><strong>Endpoints</strong> are defined and numbered during initialization, so tend to remain fairly permanent, whereas a pipe may be opened/closed</li>
<li>Two types of pipe: <strong>stream</strong> and <strong>message</strong></li>
<li><strong>Message pipes</strong> are bi-directional, used for control transfers short, simple commands + status response</li>
<li><strong>Stream pipes</strong> are uni-directional, transfers data in isochronous, interrupt or bulk transfer</li>
<li>A set of endpoints with associated metadata is also known as an <strong>interface</strong>, each is associated with a single device function</li>
<li>All USB <strong>devices have at least one endpoint</strong> (0), default, used for control transfers. Descriptors sent on default pipe can describe other endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptors</strong> form a hierarchy that you can view with tools like <code>lsusb</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Device descriptor</strong>: contains information like device Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different transport types that can be used:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interrupt transfers</strong> are for short periodic real-time data exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>Isochronous transfers</strong> are somewhat similar but less strict; they allow for larger data blocks and are used by web cameras and similar devices, where delays or even losses of a single frame are not crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Bulk transfers</strong> are for large amounts of data.</li>
<li><strong>Control transfer type</strong> is the only one that has a standardised request (and response) format, and is used to manage devices</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="usb-re-intro"></a>USB Reverse Engineering: An Introduction</h2>

<p>Now, I could probably go through and write a whole blog post on this.. but, other people have done it for me! The following walks through an introduction to interfacing with, reverse engineering, understanding, and ultimately implementing software to drive a USB remote control car.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linuxvoice.com/drive-it-yourself-usb-car-6/">https://www.linuxvoice.com/drive-it-yourself-usb-car-6/</a> (2015)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vsinitsyn/usbcar.py">https://github.com/vsinitsyn/usbcar.py</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I found it quite easy to consume, and doesn&#39;t really assume much in the way of prior knowledge.</p>

<p>One of the tools used above was <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsusb"><code>lsusb</code></a>: &quot;a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system and the devices connected to them&quot;. Among other things, this allows the <strong>vendor and product ID</strong> of the device to be identified. Once identified, this tag can be used to query further information about the device, eg. <code>lsusb -vd 0a81:0702</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Other relevant tools/concepts used include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>usbmon</code>: a facility in kernel which is
used to collect traces of I/O on the USB bus</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB">Wireshark USB Capture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb">PyUSB</a> : USB access for Python</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/libusb/libusb">libusb</a> : A cross-platform library to access USB devices</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="usb-re-further-reading"></a>USB Reverse Engineering: Further Reading</h2>

<p>The following are some additional relatively short reads on how others have approached reverse engineering some devices, including tools they used, and basic methodologies.</p>

<p><a name="adafruit"></a>I would definitely suggest checking this one out first:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/hacking-the-kinect">https://learn.adafruit.com/hacking-the-kinect</a> (2012, 2015?)</li>
</ul>

<p>By this stage you&#39;re probably not going to pick up masses of new information, but here are the rest for completeness, just in case:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/kstephens/luxeed">https://github.com/kstephens/luxeed</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some common tools/methods used in the above articles include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Explore / Capture

<ul>
<li><code>lsusb -vv</code> (*nix) (<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsusb">ref</a>) / <code>system_profiler SPUSBDataType</code> (macOS) / <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html">USBDeview</a> (Windows)</li>
<li><code>usbmon</code> / USBsnoop / SnoopyPro</li>
<li><a href="#hardware-commercial-beagleusb">Beagle480 / Beagle Data Center Software</a></li>
<li>Virtualbox / KVM / QEMU</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB">Wireshark</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interact

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/libusb/libusb">libusb</a> / libusb-win32</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb">PyUSB</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The basic process seems to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup to capture the device</li>
<li>Identify the Vendor ID and Product ID</li>
<li>Determine the device descriptors / endpoints</li>
<li>Capture USB traffic / attempt to decode commands</li>
<li>Make a driver / program to interact</li>
<li>Potentially fuzz for other commands (generally safer to do read only)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another method of reverse engineering could be to reverse the device driver itself, and understand the functionality/features from that. This takes a more &#39;traditional&#39; software reverse engineering approach to solving the problem.</p>

<p>If you want to be completely thorough, a hybrid approach may make the most sense (eg. analyse the traffic on from the device itself, then use the existing driver to help understand the data being sent back/forth and/or confirm you have captured all of the features)</p>

<h2><a name="software"></a>Software: Wireshark, usbmon, USBPcap, VirtualBox, etc</h2>

<p>So as we learned in the above articles, there are a number of &#39;software only&#39; methods we can use to capture/inspect USB traffic, with the main modern methods being:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB">WireShark</a></li>
<li><a href="http://desowin.org/usbpcap/">USBpcap</a> (<a href="https://github.com/desowin/usbpcap">GitHub</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt">usbmon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is also possible to &#39;pass through&#39; USB devices with your favourite virtual machine software (VMware, Parallels, Virtualbox, KVM, QEMU, etc) to assist in capturing data, though I will leave that as an exercise to the reader to look up the specifics (some references are in the above walkthroughs).</p>

<p>There are also some older programs and methods that might still work but probably aren&#39;t ideal anymore, including:</p>

<h2><a name="hardware-usbsniffer"></a>Hardware: BeagleBoard-XM / USBSniffer (~2010-2013, ~$149+)</h2>

<p>Based on a <a href="https://www.elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2010_Projects/USBSniffer">2010 GSoC BeagleBoard USB Sniffer</a>, this is an updated version of a <a href="http://beagleboard.org/beagleboard-xm">BeagleBoard-XM</a> based USB sniffer. It acts as a man-in-the-middle hardware proxy allowing USB traffic to be captured, and later viewed in Wireshark or similar.</p>

<h2><a name="hardware-openvizsla"></a>Hardware: OpenVizsla (~2010-2014)</h2>

<p>(You probably just want to look at <a href="hardware-daisho">daisho</a> below)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OpenVizsla is a Open Hardware FPGA-based USB analyzer. Unlike other similar devices on the market, hardware design files are available as well as full source code for the firmware and client software of the device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bushing/openvizsla-open-source-usb-protocol-analyzer">Kickstarter Project</a> to create an &quot;Open Hardware FPGA-based USB analyzer&quot; targeting <strong>USB 2.0 High-Speed</strong>. There seems to be a lot of mixed opinions/views about this project on the internet/forums calling scam and similar. It sounds like there were a lot of delays and other issues.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://debugmo.de/2014/05/ov3-hardware/">this blog post</a>, it sounds like they eventually got something working (years later) under the moniker &#39;OV3&#39;. There seem to be a number of related posts on this blog <a href="http://debugmo.de/tags/OpenVizsla/">under the tag &#39;OpenVizsla&#39;</a>:</p>

<h2><a name="hardware-serialusb"></a>Hardware: SerialUSB / GIMX USB Adapter (~2015, ~US$5-35)</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A cheap USB proxy for input devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SerialUSB is at the low end of hardware capture devices, designed to be a low cost solution to assist in adding support for USB gaming peripheral protocols to the <a href="http://blog.gimx.fr/">GIMX</a> project.</p>

</ul>

<p>For most purposes we probably won&#39;t need hardware for things at this level.. the software-based capture devices are likely good enough. But who knows.. maybe there are other uses for super cheap hardware capture..</p>

<h2><a name="hardware-goodfet"></a>Hardware: GoodFET (~2009-2018+, ~US$50)</h2>

<p>(Before I dive in too deeply.. if you want the latest/greatest in this space, check out the <a href="#hardware-greatfet">GreatFET</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The GoodFET is an open-source JTAG adapter, loosely based upon the TI MSP430 FET UIF and EZ430U boards, as described in their documentation. In addition to JTAG, the GoodFET has been <strong>inspired by HackADay&#39;s Bus Pirate to become a universal serial bus interface.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It &quot;is a nifty little tool for quickly exposing embedded system buses to userland Python code.&quot;. Based on the bits and pieces I can pull together, I believe this will allow us to do our typical hardware based sniffing/dumping/etc, but I would have to find a better walkthrough/try it myself before being able to say that for certain.</p>

<p>Now one thing about this project that tends to confuse me is the versions/revision naming.. for example here are a number of the older revisions and their names:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet10/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet10/</a> (rev 1, retired)</li>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet11/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet11/</a> (rev 2, retired)</li>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet20/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet20/</a> (rev 3, retired)</li>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/badfet20/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/badfet20/</a> (rev 4, retired)</li>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet30/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet30/</a> (rev 5, retired)</li>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet21/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet21/</a> (rev 6, retired)</li>

<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet40/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet40/</a> (rev 12, retired)</li>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet41/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet41/</a> (rev 13, retired)</li>
</ul>

<p>As best I can tell.. there seem to be multiple parallel hardware versions at certain times.. based on different chipsets. And those versions may fork/merge at later times. Attempting to follow that logic.. the two most current (non-retired) revisions seem to be:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet42/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet42/</a> (rev 22)</li>
<li><a href="http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet32/">http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/goodfet32/</a> (rev 25)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should probably just spend time browsing around this site in general.. there are so many interesting sounding open-hardware designs.</p>

<h2><a name="hardware-facedancer"></a>Hardware: Facedancer, Beagledancer, Raspdancer (~2012-2018+, ~US$85-???)</h2>

<p>(Make sure to look at the <a href="hardware-facedancer-2">facedancer 2.0</a> below as well)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Facedancer21 is the twenty-fourth hardware revision of the GoodFET, owing its heritage to the GoodFET41 and Facedancer20. Unlike the general-purpose GoodFET boards, <strong>the only purpose of this board is to allow USB devices to be written in host-side Python</strong>, so that one workstation can fuzz-test the USB device drivers of another host.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The facedancer is less about capturing data, and more about emulating a USB device with software (python to be exact!). One reason for wanting to do this might be to fuzz the devices drivers on a host system, though I&#39;m sure there could be a number of other creative uses too.. Maybe you want to allow one hardware device to masquerade as another and talk to it&#39;s drivers..</p>

<p>The following articles are a good read:</p>

<li><a href="http://rmspeers.com/archives/252">Scapy Support for USB Protocol on Facedancer Boards, MAX2420, etc</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The Facedancer hardware extends the GoodFET framework to allow for fast prototyping and fuzzing of USB device drivers. Software connect/disconnect allows the enumeration process to be repeated, and Ryan&#39;s fork allows for clean coding of the various data structures with Scapy.</p>

<p>If I&#39;ve missed anyone that you feel deserves to be here too, please let me know!</p>

<h2><a name="code-drivers-etc"></a>Code/Drivers/etc</h2>

<p>So we know how to capture traffic from our devices, proxy it with hardware, break the protocols down and understand them. But we also want to be able to talk back to them, control them, and truly interact. This is where code and drivers comes in. Now we&#39;ve sort of skimmed over these topics in a few of the above sections, but for the sake of clarity I wanted to group them all here as well.</p>

<p><a name="libusb-pyusb"></a>When I first thought about writing this section I thought we were going to be getting deep into kernel drivers, and fighting with arcane systems, but it seems we actually have a much nicer alternative before all of that, thanks to <strong>libusb, pyusb, and friends</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://libusb.info/">http://libusb.info/</a> (<a href="https://github.com/libusb/libusb">GitHub</a>) : A cross-platform library to access USB devices</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/LibUsbDotNet/LibUsbDotNet">https://github.com/LibUsbDotNet/LibUsbDotNet</a> : Library for cross-platform USB device control using Mono/.NET</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see examples of using libusb/pyUSB in some of the walkthroughs mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Now while these libraries give us a whole lot of power and makes it pretty easy to write our software, there may be times where they just don&#39;t quite cover what we need. That&#39;s when we can go deeper into the weird and wonderful world of driver development. I won&#39;t cover this too in-depth at the moment as it could be a whole blog series on it&#39;s own, but a few resources to get you started:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk">https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk</a> : Usb Drivers Development Kit for Windows</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="where-next"></a>Where next? Device Emulation, USB over IP, etc</h2>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve figured out all of the intricacies of the device, understand it&#39;s protocol and wrote some software (or even a driver) to interface with it.. what about the other side of things?</p>

<ul>
<li>Can we emulate the device in software (for testing, or other purposes)</li>
<li>Can we take the information from that device and stream it somewhere remotely?</li>
<li>Can we make a new hardware device that &#39;presents itself&#39; as the device we just looked at? (eg. to interface with existing drivers/software)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is where device emulation and USB over IP can come to the party. I haven&#39;t dug too deeply into this topic, but a well placed Google search or two (<code>github usb over ip</code>, <code>github usb emulation</code>) turned up some interesting looking resources (and I&#39;m sure there are far more out there..):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/forensix/libusbip">forensix/libusbip</a> : USB over IP</li>

</ul>

<p>Also, don&#39;t forget those hardware devices mentioned above that are designed for emulation..</p>

<p>Definitely an area that could be interesting to explore deeper, maybe in a future project/post.</p>

<h2><a name="iot-hardware-hacking-fuzzing-etc"></a>IoT, Hardware Hacking, Fuzzing, etc</h2>

<p>Once we understand the language these devices speak, how to listen to it, how to emulate it.. what&#39;s next? One idea is to apply the concept of fuzzing used in the software world (random/crafted data used to look for crashes in software), and turn it to hardware. And with the prevalence of IoT devices out there now (often with woeful security).. this could be another interesting rabbithole to explore (google: <code>usb hardware fuzzing</code>):</p>

What originally started out as me wanting to dump a few links I was collecting as I read into this subject, <strong>we seem to have ended up with a rough reference guide to getting started on AllTheThings(tm) relating to USB reverse engineering and associated hardware hacking.</strong></p>

<p>While this post by itself isn&#39;t going to give you all the answers, hopefully it&#39;s given you enough of a base that you can branch out and dig deeper into the aspects that interest you. And when you do, let me know what you build/break/discover!</p>

<p>Was there something I missed? A new shiny piece of hardware? An amazing program? Maybe you have some awesome techniques to share? Or just a story about what you&#39;ve been able to do with this newfound knowledge? I&#39;d love to hear from you in the comments below!</p>

	     <p>I tend to dive down rabbit holes a lot, and given the cost of context switching and memory deteriorating over time, sometimes the state I build up in my mind gets lost between the chances I get to dive in. These &#39;linkdump&#39; posts are an attempt to collate at least some of that state in a way that I can hopefully restore to my brain at a later point.</p>

<p>This time around I was inspired to look into Red/Infrared light therapy, originally motivated by some Bulletproof blog posts/talk (<a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/health-benefits-red-light-therapy/">1</a>, <a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/light-hacking-for-better-energy-mood-and-performance/">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/tag/light-hacking/">etc</a>), and the cost of the <a href="https://joovv.com/products/joovv-light?variant=39356431502">Joovv</a> light panels. Let&#39;s dig in!</p>

<h2>Joovv</h2>

<p><a href="https://joovv.com/">Joovv</a> is one of those hip health/wellness brands making red/infrared light therapy devices. They tout all of the good buzzwords like low/free of EMF, etc, and they&#39;re working in an emerging space (light therapy) that at least at a cursory level of skimming the research sounds like it could have some really cool benefits. The downside? Popular brands and fancy marketing costs money, businesses need money to survive, and so for the <a href="https://joovv.com/products/joovv-light?variant=39356431502">Joovv Mini</a> we&#39;re looking at about ~US$600. Too expensive for my tastes, particularly for what appears to just be an array of LEDs.</p>

<p>Now, being a builder/breaker type, with a growing interest in the hardware/maker side.. I decided to look into it a little and figure if I could build my own. For reasons, for science!</p>

<p>So looking at the <a href="https://joovv.com/products/joovv-light?variant=39356431502">Joovv Mini</a>, we can infer the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are 2 grids of LEDs, each consisting of a 6x5 array of LEDs, for a total of 30 LEDs per grid, or 60 in the entire Joov Mini</li>
<li>If you get the mixed Red/Infra Red panels, you end up with: 14 red (660nm), 16 near infrared (850nm) per grid (28 red, 32 near infrared total)</li>
<li>Power consumption is 120w, so divided by the total LEDs (60), they seem to be 2w LEDs</li>
<li>There are 2 cooling fans, so that is probably 1 per grid</li>
<li>Total dimensions are: 15&quot; x 8.25&quot; x 3&quot;</li>
<li>Irradiance/treatment area are listed as: &gt;100+mw/cm^2, 25&quot; x 18&quot; (these will vary based on wavelength, distance used, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>The other models just appear to use different counts of the &#39;LED grid&#39;, and include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://joovv.com/products/joovv-light?variant=39356431502">Joovv Mini</a>: 2 grids, 60 LEDs, 2 fans, 120w, ~US$595 (or ~US$9.91/LED)</li>
<li><a href="https://joovv.com/products/joovv-light?variant=39356431694">Joovv Original</a>: 5 grids, 150 LEDs, 5 fans, 300w, ~US$995 (or ~US$6.6/LED)</li>
<li><a href="https://joovv.com/products/joovv-light?variant=39356431886">Joovv Max</a>: 16 grids, 480 LEDs, 16 fans, 960w, ~US$2695 (or ~US$5.6/LED)</li>
</ul>

<p>So this gives us some pretty good starting parameters from a &#39;best of breed&#39; product, to use as a basis when we go digging around elsewhere. It also goes to show that there is probably a decent bit of margin between hardware costs and final product (as there always is), so DIY savings abound! We want:</p>

<ul>
<li>A bunch of 2w (or higher) red (660nm)/NIR (850nm) LEDs</li>
<li>Some fans</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Casing, etc</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Commercial Products</h2>

<p>So there are a number of other products in this space too.. just a couple off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://catalyticcolor.com/redjuvenator-light-therapy/">REDjuvenator</a>

<ul>
<li>15 x 15 array of LEDs (225 total), 1 foot square panel</li>
<li>Formula #1: Looks like all red LEDs</li>
<li>Formula #2: Looks like red/near infrared</li>
<li>Formula #3: Claims the benefits of #1 + #2</li>
<li>Formula #4: &#39;Bacteria buster&#39;, looks like red + UV LEDs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bulletproof Labs <a href="http://bulletprooflabs.com/body/">REDcharger</a> (which is a rebranding of another device.. but I forget the name at the moment..): 630nm/880nm. I think there were like 40,000 LEDs in this.. I feel like there was some small amount of blue/UV in there as well from memory..</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sourcing LEDs</h2>

<p>Now I haven&#39;t done a whole lot in this hardware building space before.. but I do know that <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">AliExpress</a> tends to have AllTheThings(tm).. I won&#39;t directly link as you may find better deals, but a few searches included:</p>

<ul>
<li>660nm led</li>
<li>850nm led</li>
</ul>

<p>Now.. I could go for the 2w spec like Joovv uses.. but maybe there are more interesting/cheaper combinations. Looking through the search results the following seemed common: 1w, 3w, 5w. Maybe we could change up the parameters for our build? For example, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10pcs-1W-3W-High-Power-LED-Full-Spectrum-White-Warm-white-Green-Blue-Deep-Red-660nm/32859370682.html">one supplier</a> listed the following (may not be the best price, or the best supplier, just one example):</p>

<ul>
<li>1w, deep red (660nm): ~US$3.10/10pc == US$0.31/ea</li>
<li>3w, deep red (660nm): ~US$3.50/10pc == US$0.35/ea</li>
<li>1w, infrared (850nm): ~US$6.90/10pc == US$0.69/ea</li>
<li>3w, infrared (850nm): ~US$7.90/10pc == US$0.79/ea</li>
</ul>

<p>So from a completely naive back of napkin cost calculation using the 3w LEDs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mini: 28 red (~US$9.80), 32 NIR (~US$25.28), <strong>Total:</strong> ~US$35.08</li>
<li>Original: 70 red (~US$24.50), 80 NIR (~US$63.20), <strong>Total:</strong> ~US$87.70</li>
<li>Max: 224 red (~US$78.40), 256 NIR (~US$202.24), <strong>Total:</strong> ~US$280.64</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously there will be additional costs for the power supply, fans, casing, construction, etc.. but those costs seem far nicer to me.</p>

<p>There were also some <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Power-LED-Chip-Deep-Red-LED-660nm-Plant-Grow-Light-1W-3W-5W-10W-20W/32633843531.html">other providers</a> that had some interesting looking LED arrays, with powers such as: 1w, 3w, 5w, 10w, 20w, 30w, 50w, 100w. So we could go super powerful if we wanted (though maybe wouldn&#39;t get as good coverage..). Also.. is there a sweet spot for the power/brightness? Need to dig into the research more for that.. It sounds like there is.</p>

<p>In doing some reading, it seems that a lot of the &#39;grow lights&#39; actually operate in the same spectrums (good for plants, good for us!), so that may be another path worth looking into.</p>

<h2>But what about EMFs?</h2>

<p>So one of the claims among a number of these products is that they&#39;re &#39;low/free from EMFs&#39;, and a cursory skim of some of the research sounds plausible that EMFs could be a thing worth caring about (search terms: EMF voltage regulated calcium channels, etc). Now this isn&#39;t an area I&#39;ve really looked much into, but if we assume they are bad.. what can we do about it? Off the top of my head, and completely unsubstantiated, I would imagine some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">faraday cage</a> type device would do the trick, given it&#39;s an &quot;enclosure used to block electromagnetic fields&quot;. So maybe that&#39;s an area to read more into..</p>

<h2>But what about blue light?</h2>

<p>So.. seems we can use blue/UV light for things too.. more related to inhibiting bad stuff it seems. Could definitely be an interesting rabbit hole to dive deeper down:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5626244/">Blue light treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Strong bactericidal activity, synergism with antibiotics and inactivation of virulence factors</a>

<ul>
<li>One of the more common infection types in Cystic Fibrosis.. interesting..</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There also seems to be some stuff in the space of using blue (technically violet, 360-400nm) light for myopia/similar:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.bulletproof.com/violet-light-eye-health/">https://blog.bulletproof.com/violet-light-eye-health/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5233810/">PubMed: Violet Light Exposure Can Be a Preventive Strategy Against Myopia Progression</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Lasers!</h2>

<p>So, moving a bit away from the LED side of things.. a lot of the &#39;Low Level Laser Therapy&#39; or &#39;Cold Laser&#39; treatments out there are using laser diodes instead. They can penetrate deeper, tend to be higher power, more focussed, etc. I&#39;ve heard about these sorts of things being used to aid in healing of injured joints and more, enough to catch my interest. But once again, these things are expensive (a treatment might cost you $50/session).. and hard to come buy for the biohacker type who isn&#39;t a medical professional. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thorlaser.com/products/">THOR Laser</a>

<ul>
<li>~US$14,000-24,000</li>
<li>Various LED/laser probe options (810nm IR laser, 660nm laser, etc)</li>
<li>These ones sound quite low powered too: 30mW, 75mW, 200mW, etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://multiradiance.com.au/products/mr4-super-pulsed-laser">MR4 Super Pulsed Laser</a>:

<ul>
<li>~AU$10,000</li>
<li>Infrared (860-960nm)</li>
<li>Red (600-740nm)</li>
<li>Laser (25w, pulsed)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So looking deeper into the wavelengths, power levels, and options, we find:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.coldlasers.org/therapy/wavelength/">https://www.coldlasers.org/therapy/wavelength/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Skimming through some of this stuff.. it sounds like we want to look into pulsed/super pulsed laser diodes.. but what are they?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pulselaserrelief.com.au/super-pulsed-low-level-laser-therapy">https://www.pulselaserrelief.com.au/super-pulsed-low-level-laser-therapy</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> high power, low heat, deeper penetration, 904-905nm Gallium Arsenide (GaAS) diode</p>

<p>And if we turn to our trusty component dealer <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">AliExpress</a>, we turn up a few interesting search results:</p>

<ul>
<li>pulsed laser diode 25w</li>
</ul>

<p>Now remember.. lasers are dangerous, you can and will destroy your eyes if you do bad things with them. Always wear proper laser eye safety when doing anything like this. Also, if you&#39;re in a country like Australia, they may just actually not let you import these full stop.. yay for draconian laws! There might be a way around it for &#39;legit reasons&#39; (rather than annoying cats with red dots), but it&#39;s not an area I&#39;ve deeply looked into yet.</p>

<p>Now that that&#39;s out of the way.. maybe like ~US$25 for a laser diode.. and then need to power it, probably cool it, etc. Better than $25k!</p>

<h2>Link Dump</h2>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve got all of that out of the way, how about that link dump:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redlighttherapy.com.au/">https://www.redlighttherapy.com.au/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://draxe.com/red-light-therapy/">https://draxe.com/red-light-therapy/</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3288797/">PubMed: The Nuts and Bolts of Low-level Laser (Light) Therapy</a>

<ul>
<li>&quot;The wavelengths of light used for LLLT fall into an “optical window” at red and NIR wavelengths (600–1070 nm) (Fig. 1d). Effective tissue penetration is maximized in this range, as the principal tissue chromophores (hemoglobin and melanin) have high absorption bands at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm. Wavelengths in the range 600–700 nm are used to treat superficial tissue, and longer wavelengths in the range 780–950 nm, which penetrate further, are used to treat deeper-seated tissues. Wavelengths in the range 700–770 nm have been found to have limited biochemical activity and are therefore not used.&quot;</li>

</ul>

<p>And if we want to try sensing/reading different wavelengths (maybe for testing, or reverse engineering things, or just for fun!):</p>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So now we have a wide variety of interesting starting points, and some key words/aspects to dig deeper into this area of research/DIY building. We learned that a lot of these products, while very cool and useful, also tend to be WAY overpriced. Maybe we can build our own, open source the designs/components/learnings from it, and move everyone forward together (rather than only those who have the big $$ to benefit).</p>

<p>Was this useful? Have you built your own DIY light hacking devices? Got a cool story to share? Some new research? I&#39;d love to hear what you&#39;re doing in this space in the comments below!</p>
