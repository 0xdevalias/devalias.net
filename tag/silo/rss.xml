   <description>My intention is for this to be a place where I post anything that interests my geeky mind. I may not update it often, and you may not find it that interesting.. You've been forewarned.

	     <p>Rather than trying to make everybody everywhere adapt their systems to try and handle everything that could possibly ever exist (a monumental task), have a &#39;new&#39; thing that is flexible enough to be able to interface with everything else.</p>

<p>Thinking about it now, it&#39;s the exact same way as I look at the transition from legacy silo&#39;s to &#39;the future&#39; of personal clouds/etc. Sure, the ideal is that everything is free and open and interacts perfectly, but the reality is that that&#39;s not where we are at today, and there is a very real need for these &#39;bridging technologies&#39; to ease that transition as we move forward, and give us the wins of the future technology, without having to wait for the lag of general industry to catch up.</p>
