	     <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> introduced an amusing little April Fools feature called &#39;Unicoins&#39;. Essentially, this currency (that you can earn by mining rocks, since all of the (rather amusing) payment options are currently unavailable&#39;) allows you to by silly upgrades for the website. From &#39;Colorful comments&#39; and &#39;Guaranteed Answer&#39; through to &#39;Voting animations&#39; which gives you &#39;happy unicorn animations everytime you vote&#39;.</p>

<p>Anyways, long story short, I saw a system and wondered how to beat it. Turns out each rock is simply an AJAX request to /unicoin/rock to get a rock ID, and when you sucessfully mine it, you POST back a static fkey (bound to each user I assume?) and the rockId to /unicoin/mine?rock=theRockId</p>

<p>I&#39;ve put together a little automagical javascript to prevent you all getting RSI. It&#39;s for health reasons.. honestly.</p>

<p>Enjoy your unicoins! &lt;3 /dev/alias</p>
