   <description>My intention is for this to be a place where I post anything that interests my geeky mind. I may not update it often, and you may not find it that interesting.. You've been forewarned.

	     <p>So, I have just migrated all of the (very few) posts from my older tumblog to here, which will be the new home of my random techy rantings and postings. I don&#39;t expect to update this all that often, but hopefully when I do it will be interesting.. or at least, not boring.</p>
