   <description>My intention is for this to be a place where I post anything that interests my geeky mind. I may not update it often, and you may not find it that interesting.. You've been forewarned.

	     <p>I&#39;ve been meaning to write this post for a while now, but never quite got around to it. Oftentimes when a friend or colleague gets a new mac they ask me what programs I would recommend. I tend to stumble at being asked on the spot, and rattle off the couple that jump straight to mind.</p>

<p>To save myself the embarassment, serve as a memory jog, and hopefully help some people out along the way, here is my list of programs I use/love on OSX (see after the break)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This isn&#39;t necessarily a definitive list, but it should be the main ones, and I will try to keep it updated as I find new cool things that I love.</p>

<h2>General/System</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://brew.sh/">HomeBrew</a> - Think apt-get, but for mac. Awesome way to find/install commandline tools/etc for your mac.</li>
<li><a href="https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/">HyperDock</a> - Show previews of docked program windows when you hover over them. Just like Windows 7!</li>
<li><a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/">TotalFinder</a> - Tabs and other such win for the finder!</li>

<li><a href="http://www.appzapper.com/">AppZapper</a> - The uninstall feature that&#39;s missing from so many mac programs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Internet/Download/Etc</h2>

<li><a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> - Think dropbox, but more aimed at notes/etc. Available anywhere I need access to them.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.xmind.net/">XMind</a> - Not that this fits into the cloud/syncing category by itself (dropbox!), but a good little tool for making mindmaps.</li>
</ul>

	  <title>RockMelt - Beta 2 Announced</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>So in followup to my previous post on RockMelt, they have just put up news that beta 2 will be out soon with all sorts of sexy improvements! Chat had been redesigned to make chatting to multiple people easier, they have included a View Later app (think Instapaper or ReadItLater), a new Twitter app, and it now all runs on Chromium 10! I can&#39;t wait till it&#39;s available for download.</p>

<p>rockmelt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re excited to introduce RockMelt Beta 2! While we&#39;ve shipped 20 updates since November, RockMelt Beta 2 represents our most significant revision so far.Â One thing we&#39;re really proud of is how much people actually use RockMelt. People use RockMelt for more than 6 hours each day to share links...</p>

	  <title>The Dark Side - Macbook Pro</title>
	  <link>/devalias/2011/09/16/the-dark-side-macbook-pro/</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I am a firm believer in the &#39;build it yourself&#39; aspect of computing, and with that comes an inherent dislike for the overpriced, simplistic, bright coloured devilspawn known as Apple. With that being said, there was a time that I walked among the darkness, though it was many many ages ago. Over recent years I have been drawing ever slowly back in that direction though, each shiny new device they release bringing me that much closer. It seems now that I have finally stepped over that threshold, into the darkness once more.</p>

<p>Last saturday I purchased a Macbook Pro. <em>shudders</em> I swore to myself I wouldn&#39;t ever buy an overpriced, mainstream, &#39;cool&#39;, bright coloured apple computer. In my defense, the new Macbook Pro is very very shiny, decked out with a 15&quot; screen, 2.2ghz cpu, 8gb ram, 1gb graphics, 500gb 7200rpm hdd and packaged in a &#39;unibody&#39; slab of metal for the case.</p>

<p>Now the case is somewhat shiny, though it could do with some harder lines/edges and a much darker shade to give it that look that I like in my hardware. As the plan currently stands, a few vinyl stickers should give it that darker and more interesting look. Probably a black background, biohazard around the apple in bright green, a BackTrack dragon, maybe a few other things, and a carbon fibre look around the keyboard.</p>

<p>All in all pretty happy with my purchase. Should be powerful enough to satisfy my portable computing needs, as well as running BackTrack in Parallels for pentesting, as well as having a full coding environment set up for writing iPhone software.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll post again once I have it set up, hopefully with some pictures and thoughts about the setup process.</p>

	  <title>RockMelt - Your Browser. Re-Imagined.</title>
	  <link>/devalias/2011/09/16/rockmelt-your-browser-re-imagined/</link>
	  <author>devalias</author>
	  <pubDate>2011-09-16T12:59:00+10:00</pubDate>
	  <guid>/devalias/2011/09/16/rockmelt-your-browser-re-imagined/</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>So I have been using this browser for a few weeks now, and I must say, I am VERY impressed. I was looking for something to streamline my vast (and ever increasing) presence on the social web, something that would let me keep up to date with everything, without the need to constantly F5.</p>

<p>Rockmelt is built off the Google Chromium browser. It integrates with Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, RSS, etc via a number of features including it&#39;s &#39;Edges&#39; (side bars that contain apps/feeds).</p>

<p>While Rockmelt is still in beta (and only a few days ago moved from closed to public beta) I find it a rather usable browser. With that being said there are still a few things that are needed to make it an even better experience. Namely</p>

<ul>
<li>More integration with other social sites (this feature is being worked on)</li>
<li>The ability to scroll the &#39;edges&#39;, or to group RSS feeds/etc so as to be able to fit more things on each edge.</li>
<li>Not a feature with the browser as such, but better transparency with what the Rockmelt team are working on. It would be nice to have a roadmap of planned features, and/or a changelog so that we can see what was modified in each update.</li>
<li>While it still has a ways to go, I feel that RockMelt is well on it&#39;s way to making itself a #1 choice for socially integrating browser.</li>
</ul>
